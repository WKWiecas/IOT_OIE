The hosts went two points in front at twenty seven minutes scoring a try off the back of a rolling maul .


Caloundra retook the lead five minutes later through another penalty goal .


University hit back right off the resulting kickoff scoring their second try , which they converted .


This score was at such a pace that the reporter of this article was still transcribing the notes for the previous penalty goal .


The second half opened with University forcing a scrum five metres from Caloundra 's try line .


This was achieved by making Caloundra ground the ball behind said try line after carrying it over .


The game was held up briefly by back-to-back injury stoppages at about the fifteen minute mark .


Caloundra would score their third penalty goal of the game two minutes after play resumed .


Their fourth would come five minutes later taking the scores to 17 -- 12 in University 's favour .


University slotted the match 's final penalty goal around five minutes before full time .


In the other A-grade game , Noosa defeated Maroochydore 24 -- 10 .

Climate models predicted more greenhouse gases would weaken the equatorial Pacific trade winds .


However , over the past two decades , observations showed this Walker circulation was getting stronger , accelerating sea level rise in the western Pacific , and consequent changes in global climate .

While previous research supposed natural variability alone accounted for cooling in the eastern Pacific , this study highlights a previously overlooked climate feedback : as the Atlantic warms , it alters the winds over the Pacific , depressing the ocean temperature there .


As coauthor Shayne McGregor of the University of New South Wales explains , `` the main cause of the Pacific wind , temperature , and sea level trends over the past 20 years lies in the Atlantic Ocean -LSB- ... -RSB- We saw that the rapid Atlantic surface warming observed since the early 1990s , induced partly by greenhouse gases , has generated unusually low sea level pressure over the tropical Atlantic .

This , in turn , produces an upward motion of the overlying air parcels .


These parcels move westward aloft and then sink again in the eastern equatorial Pacific , where their sinking creates a high pressure system .

Work earlier this year by coauthor Matthew England , University of New South Wales , showed the stronger winds have churned up the waters of the Western Pacific Ocean , so more heat flows from the winds into the water .


This appears to explain why global surface temperatures have recently risen more slowly .


Coauthor Axel Timmermann of the University of Hawaii notes a further amplifying effect : `` Stronger trade winds in the equatorial Pacific also increase the upwelling of cold waters to the surface .


The resulting near-surface cooling in the eastern Pacific amplifies the Atlantic -- Pacific pressure seesaw , thus further intensifying the trade winds -LSB- ... -RSB- It turns out that the current generation of climate models underestimates the extent of the Atlantic -- Pacific coupling , which means that they can not properly capture the observed eastern Pacific cooling , which has contributed significantly to the leveling off , or the hiatus , in global warming . ``

China has objected against the Indian presence , calling for foreign countries to stay out of the South China Sea , maintaining China 's claims there as indisputable .


The announcement follows claims of responsibility from forces loyal to Libyan General Khalifa Haftar , who has been moving in support of militias involved in the widespread conflict within the country .


Egypt has denied responsibility , with sources reporting the government of the UAE has thus far declined to comment .


There had already been evidence suggesting foreign involvement , with reports of US-made bomb fragments found in wreckage in Tripoli .


Previous attacks by General Haftar 's forces have reportedly struck Benghazi , with Libyan planes said to lack the range or capabilities for a night time attack on a target as distant as Tripoli .

U.S . Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont , an independent who caucuses with Democrats , revealed through the Associated Press -LRB- AP -RRB- yesterday that he plans to announce by March whether to run for President of the United States in the 2016 election .


Sanders , a self-identified Socialist who champions against income inequality , says he will make a `` gut decision `` about whether to run .


Though often touted as a potential presidential candidate , Sanders has never made a run for the presidency .


Sanders , 73 , entered politics in the 1970s , running for various races in Vermont as a member of the anti-war Liberty Union Party .


After serving in that capacity for 16 years , Sanders won election to the United States Senate , where he has remained .


Sanders cites the United States wealth gap as `` collapsing `` the nation 's middle class , but says a cure exists in his twelve step solution , which includes infrastructure projects , fair trade , and alternative energy .

Nevertheless , Sanders told the AP his decision on 2016 rests on whether he believes he can win the election .


Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , who ran unsuccessfully for president in 2008 , figures to be the frontrunner for the 2016 Democratic nomination .


Experts are divided on how a Sanders candidacy would affect her prospects .


Democratic National Committee member Kathy Sullivan says Sanders may be `` a step too far for the mainstream `` of the party .


But former New Hampshire State Senator Peter Burling argues Sanders can deliver with passion , something he says that Clinton lacks .


Other potential candidates for the Democratic nomination include Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts , Maryland governor Martin O'Malley , New York governor Andrew Cuomo , and Vice President Joe Biden .

The nation is moving to hold new elections with President Michel Martelly presently ruling by decree .


Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council -LRB- CEP -RRB- of nine members yesterday .


Last month a presidential commission recommended the prior CEP 's resignation as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections .


The commission was Martelly 's response to widespread anti-regime protests that started in October .


The sometimes-violent protests were triggered by failure to hold elections , some due since 2011 .


On January 12 the Senate was reduced to a defunct ten members , with sixteen required for a quorum .


Amendments to electoral law were required by the Senate before elections due in 2011 could be held .


Rival political factions were unable to resolve disagreements .


The lower level of parliament , the Chamber of Deputies , also saw all 99 seats vacated .


Also due are municipal elections , with 4,000 local posts needing refilled .


A presidential election is due this year and the constitution forbids a consecutive term for Martelly .

CEP members were sworn in yesterday at the Supreme Court ; the presidential commission also recommended a new head for the court .


This month Martelly installed a new cabinet including opposition members , amongst them appointing Evans Paul as Prime Minister .


Paul replaces Laurent Lamothe who resigned last month at the request of Martelly 's commission .


Paul was yesterday joined by foreign diplomats to welcome the new CEP in Petionville , the CEP headquarters .


Protests continued around the nation yesterday , with anger directed at foreign leaders who have supported Martelly as well as the local regime .

Their actions have come under scrutiny as the National Transportation Safety Committee -LRB- NTSC -RRB- investigates .


The aircraft entered an excessively steep climb before stalling , the NTSC said last month .


It took three minutes for the plane to reach the water , during which time the flight crew tried to regain control .


Bloomberg claims the flight crew switched off computers designed to aid them after they issued alerts .


AirAsia has declined to comment pending the NTSC investigation , which is expected to continue for several months .

Edgar Lungu , the current President of Zambia , is to undergo medical treatment aboard after collapsing while on stage in Lusaka on Sunday during a ceremony for International Women 's Day .


The Presidency announced yesterday that Lungu will have throat surgery abroad .


Lungu spoke to the press from hospital on Sunday saying `` I am looking forward to going home .


Doctors have done their tests and they have found traces of malaria , but they are doing further tests and they will let me know what next after before the end of the day `` .

A later announcement identified his condition instead as a narrowing of the oesophagus , which he had previously received treatment for three decades ago .


Despite not announcing where Lungu would head to be treated the Presidency did say he would undergo a `` high-tech medical procedure which is currently unavailable in Zambia `` .


Lungu , who only became the Zambian President in January , has previously dispelled rumours of his health .


Some in Zambia have claimed the presidency is `` jinxed `` .


Lungu 's predecessor Michael Sata died in October of last year at the age of 77 in London , England .


Sata died only six years after serving President Levy Mwanawasa died following a stroke .

A report from French safety officials released on Wednesday said the co-pilot , Andreas Lubitz , practiced putting a plane into a controlled descent earlier in the day of the March 24 crash of Germanwings Flight 9525 , which officials allege the co-pilot caused by a controlled descent .


The report was based on data from the plane 's flight recorders .


According to the report , the flight data recorder indicated the captain left the cockpit for a few minutes .


During these few minutes , air traffic control told the Airbus A320 to decend from 37,000 to 35,000 feet .


But the co-pilot has set the altitude to a much lower than that before going back to 35,000 feet .


The co-pilot then set the altitude close to the ground again after air traffic control instructed descent to 21,000 feet .


The plane remained on its flight path throughout , so there was no deviation from flight path for air traffic controllers to notice .


The report does not say whether the pilot on the `` test `` flight also piloted the accident flight .

Farage has claimed these results illustrate how first-past-the-post , the electoral system used in UK general elections , is `` bankrupt because one party can get 50 % of the vote in Scotland and nearly 100 % of the seats , and our party can get 4 million votes and just one seat .

` Cause he stayed at home rather than come to London .

Like , I remember for 2012 I 'd still go and train , say , four , five times a week , and that 's mostly shooting and things like that , but now it 's not just about the shooting court skills , it 's very much all the gym sessions , the strength and conditioning .

Baumgartner proceeded with the jump anyway .


Baumgartner jumped with his head down to increase speed .


A quick jump was essential to minimise the risk of spinning out of control which could make the skydiver lose consciousness .


Baumgartner 's suit was equipped with devices to document the jump , including a camera .


They also included tools to measure altitude , speed and location , and to report them to the mission control center .

My main problem with the DoNotTrack setting right now is it is misleading .


-LRB- -LRB- Wikinews -RRB- -RRB- What do you see the ideal behaviour of companies when it comes to making a user 's profile ?


Would you like to ideally prohibit such activity entirely using legislative regulations in the long run ?


Applying that analogy , if you were on a Do Not Track list then companies should n't track you unless you explicitly ask them to , e.g . by logging in and consenting to Terms of Service .

That will only happen via legislative means , however .


-LRB- -LRB- Wikinews -RRB- -RRB- Given that not all companies respect this setting , do you feel its name misleading ?


HFB : First of all , I personally do not think the name of DoNotTrack is misleading .


However , the challenge is to have a meaningful standard that users can still be aware of the risks of that may be involved without giving a false sense of security .


For example `` private mode `` in your browser does not prevent that your internet access provider can still keep track of what websites you visit , websites can collect information about you and so on .

-LRB- -LRB- Wikinews -RRB- -RRB- How do you envision the `` self regulatory `` approach ?


HFB : Self regulation basically means that the different stakeholders without having a legal obligation to do so , comply with a set of rules , for example an industry technical specification as W3C tracking protection standards .


My take is that DNT would be a success if all major stakeholders involved in the process would comply with the standards .


It is more an open question to what extent compliance to the technical standard is sufficient to comply with applicable laws in its respective country , for instance , in EU , or in the USA .

The only issue they might have is in dismissing message banners on the projects -LRB- such as the fundraising banner -RRB- may not be completely predictable - banners may reappear after dismissing .

The learning experiment relies on a phenomenon called the Proboscis Extension Reflex -LRB- PER -RRB- whereby the bee extends its proboscis -LRB- sticks out its tongue -RRB- to receive a meal when the antennae are touched with sugar solution .


In the lab , we can blow a floral scent at the bee at the same time as delivering the sugar solution - soon , the bee learns to extend its proboscis in response to the scent , having learned that this particular scent indicates a sugar reward .


We then tested the bees ' memory , by comparing the PER response to both the trained scent , and a different novel scent .

A rather surprising finding on the memory test results was , that the bees could not tell the training odour , and a novel odour , apart - they responded to both equally , not preferring the odour associated with the sugar reward over the other odour which should have no rewarding associations .

The main difficulty involved in our study was that it involved a 6-day experimental protocol , performed every week for several months , so it was quite intensive !


Another difficulty of bee work is , it is very weather dependant - if it rains or is cold , the bees are n't out foraging and the experiment has to be postponed until the weather improves .

The legislation has caused political trouble for Prime Minister David Cameron .

Opponents of the Bill led by Tim Loughton MP submitted an amendment to allow opposite sex couples to enter into civil partnerships , which were introduced in 2004 as an alternative to marriage for same sex couples .


The government warned that Loughton 's amendment was an attempt to wreck the passage of the Bill .


Sir George Young , the Conservative chief whip , asked Labour whips to oppose the amendment despite the Labour Party previously supporting the amendment .


A Labour Party source quoted in The Guardian said they `` had an eleventh hour appeal from the government that they did not have the numbers to defeat the Tim Loughton amendment `` and that Labour leader Ed Miliband considered it an `` overriding priority -LSB- ... -RSB- to ensure that the bill gets on to the statute book .

A man has died as the result of a road traffic collision on the Outer Hebrides island of North Uist .


The accident , to which members of the police and ambulance services were called at around 01:46 BST -LRB- 0046 UTC -RRB- yesterday , happened on the A865 road between the villages of Carinish and Clachan when a black Renault Clio car hit a pedestrian .

A statement from Police Scotland said the fatality , a male aged 33 , died at the crash site despite being given medical attention .


Approximately 200 metres from the incident location is Carinish Hall , where a social event , which the deceased may have attended , was held prior to the crash .


A section of the road spanning 400 metres was closed following the accident .


The Island News and Advertiser newspaper reported police saying the road would stay closed until approximately 14:00 -- 15:00 BST -LRB- 1300 -- 1400 UTC -RRB- yesterday at the earliest .

A Divisional Road Policing Unit team of investigators from the town of Dingwall in the Scottish Highlands examined the scene during the closure .


As no diversions were available for motorists , this closure affected any traffic which had travelled via ferry to Lochmaddy in North Uist from Uig on the Isle of Skye yesterday .


Lines of vehicles in both directions were reportedly left at the scene .

Because the nymphs grow at different rates underground , a longer life cycle and a way of counting years must have evolved so that the individuals that get to the last nymphal -LRB- underground juvenile -RRB- stage first would wait long enough for all other individuals in the population to become ready to emerge .

CS : Cicadas do not chew leave so they do not damage crops like other insects .


Cicadas lay eggs in pencil-sized tree branches .


If there are not enough branches available , too many female cicadas may lay eggs in a single branch weakening it and making it susceptible to breakage by wind .

If the branches break , the eggs die so this behavior is selected against by natural selection .


Chris Simon : As an undergraduate student , I was interested in the formation of species so when I went to graduate school I looked for a study organism that was likely to be in the process of forming new species .


I chose periodical cicadas because they are broken up into reproductively isolated broods -LRB- or year classes -RRB- .


Reproductive isolation leads to speciation so I planned to study biochemical differences among the broods .

In addition to a decision on the Defense of Marriage Act , the Supreme Court also ruled on a case brought by supporters of Proposition 8 in California , a ballot measure which made same-sex marriage illegal in 2008 .


The resulting same-sex marriage ban was challenged in the court and a lower court held that the measure was incompatible with the US Constitution .

a lower court held that the measure was incompatible with the US Constitution .

The Supreme Court rejected an appeal by supporters of Proposition 8 , arguing they do not have standing to defend in court a law the State of California is unwilling to defend .


Therefore the lower court decision holds .


California Governor Jerry Brown said : `` I have directed the California Department of Public Health to advise the state 's counties they must begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples in California as soon as the Ninth Circuit confirms the stay is lifted `` .


President Barack Obama welcomed the decisions : `` When all Americans are treated as equal , no matter who they are or whom they love , we are all more free . ``

Anthony Romero from the American Civil Liberties Union said the fight for same-sex marriage rights would now return to the states .


A number of opponents of same-sex marriage have voiced their opinions on the Supreme Court decision .


Michele Bachmann , a Republican congresswoman from Minnesota , stated : `` Marriage was created by the hand of God .


No man , not even a Supreme Court , can undo what a holy God has instituted .


For thousands of years of recorded human history , no society has defended the legal standard of marriage as anything other than between man and woman .


Bachmann went on : `` Today , the U.S. Supreme Court decided to join the trend , despite the clear will of the people 's representatives through DOMA .

Tonic-clonic seizures occur with a contraction of the limbs followed by their extension along with arching of the back which lasts 10 -- 30 seconds -LRB- the tonic phase -RRB- .


A cry may be heard due to contraction of the chest muscles , followed by a shaking of the limbs in unison -LRB- clonic phase -RRB- .


Tonic seizures produce constant contractions of the muscles .


A person often turns blue as breathing is stopped .


In clonic seizures there is shaking of the limbs in unison .


After the shaking has stopped it may take 10 -- 30 minutes for the person to return to normal ; this period is called the `` postictal state `` or `` postictal phase . ``

ASEAN sought economic integration by creating the AEC by the end of 2015 .


This established a common market .


Since 2007 , ASEAN countries have gradually lowered their import duties to member nations .


Since the ACU is being considered to be a precursor to a common currency in the future , it has a dynamic outlook of the region .

Following al-Farabi 's lead , Avicenna initiated a full-fledged inquiry into the question of being , in which he distinguished between essence -LRB- Mahiat -RRB- and existence -LRB- Wujud -RRB- .


He argued that the fact of existence can not be inferred from or accounted for by the essence of existing things , and that form and matter by themselves can not interact and originate the movement of the universe or the progressive actualization of existing things .

Avicenna 's theology on metaphysical issues -LRB- ilāhiyyāt -RRB- has been criticized by some Islamic scholars , among them al-Ghazali , Ibn Taymiyya , and Ibn al-Qayyim .


While discussing the views of the theists among the Greek philosophers , namely Socrates , Plato , and Aristotle in Al-Munqidh min ad-Dalal -LRB- `` Deliverance from Error `` -RRB- , al-Ghazali noted that the Greek philosophers `` must be taxed with unbelief , as must their partisans among the Muslim philosophers , such as Ibn Sina and al-Farabi and their likes . ``

In the Al-Burhan -LRB- On Demonstration -RRB- section of The Book of Healing , Avicenna described an early scientific method of inquiry .

Avicenna discussed the issue of a proper methodology for scientific inquiry and the question of `` How does one acquire the first principles of a science ? ``


He asked how a scientist would arrive at `` the initial axioms or hypotheses of a deductive science without inferring them from some more basic premises ? ``

He explains that the ideal situation is when one grasps that a `` relation holds between the terms , which would allow for absolute , universal certainty . ``


Avicenna then adds two further methods for arriving at the first principles : the ancient Aristotelian method of induction -LRB- istiqra -RRB- , and the method of examination and experimentation -LRB- tajriba -RRB- .

The domestic bulk freight developed because of the nearby mines .


It was more economical to transport the ingredients for steel to centralized plants rather than try to make steel on the spot .


Because the lake maritime community largely developed independently , it has some distinctive vocabulary .


Ships , no matter the size , are called boats .


When the sailing ships gave way to steamships , they were called steamboats -- the same term used on the Mississippi .


The ships also have a distinctive design -LRB- see Lake freighter -RRB- .


Ships that primarily trade on the lakes are known as lakers .


Foreign boats are known as salties .


Today , the Great Lakes fleet is much smaller in numbers than it once was because of the increased use of overland freight , and a few larger ships replacing many small ones .

A raisin is any dried grape .


While raisin is a French loanword , the word in French refers to the fresh fruit ; grappe -LRB- from which the English grape is derived -RRB- refers to the bunch -LRB- as in une grappe de raisins -RRB- .


Grape juice is obtained from crushing and blending grapes into a liquid .

In 1922 , the Estonian astronomer Ernst Öpik gave a distance determination that supported the theory that the Andromeda Nebula is indeed a distant extra-galactic object .


Using the new 100 inch Mt . Wilson telescope , Edwin Hubble was able to resolve the outer parts of some spiral nebulae as collections of individual stars and identified some Cepheid variables , thus allowing him to estimate the distance to the nebulae : they were far too distant to be part of the Milky Way .

In 1936 Hubble produced a classification of galactic morphology that is used to this day .


Galaxies come in three main types : ellipticals , spirals , and irregulars .
Galaxies come in three main types : ellipticals .
Galaxies come in three main types : spirals .
Galaxies come in three main types : irregulars .

A slightly more extensive description of galaxy types based on their appearance is given by the Hubble sequence .


Since the Hubble sequence is entirely based upon visual morphological type -LRB- shape -RRB- , it may miss certain important characteristics of galaxies such as star formation rate in starburst galaxies and activity in the cores of active galaxies .

Recently , researchers described galaxies called super luminous spirals .


They thought to have an increased star formation rate around 30 times faster than the Milky Way .


These are categorized as Hubble type S0 , and they possess ill-defined spiral arms with an elliptical halo of stars -LRB- barred lenticular galaxies receive Hubble classification SB0 . -RRB-

Blazars are believed to be an active galaxy with a relativistic jet that is pointed in the direction of Earth .


A radio galaxy emits radio frequencies from relativistic jets .


A unified model of these types of active galaxies explains their differences based on the viewing angle of the observer .


Infrared galaxies emit more energy in the infrared than at all other wavelengths combined .


In June 2015 , astronomers reported evidence for Population III stars in the Cosmos Redshift 7 galaxy at z = 6.60 .


Such stars are likely to have existed in the very early universe -LRB- i.e . , at high redshift -RRB- , and may have started the production of chemical elements heavier than hydrogen that are needed for the later formation of planets and life as we know it .

Within a billion years of a galaxy 's formation , key structures begin to appear .


The creation of a supermassive black hole appears to play a key role in actively regulating the growth of galaxies by limiting the total amount of additional matter added .


During this early epoch , galaxies undergo a major burst of star formation .


On the largest scale , the Universe is continually expanding , resulting in an average increase in the separation between individual galaxies -LRB- see Hubble 's law -RRB- .


Associations of galaxies can overcome this expansion on a local scale through their mutual gravitational attraction .


These associations formed early in the Universe , as clumps of dark matter pulled their respective galaxies together .


Nearby groups later merged to form larger-scale clusters .


This on-going merger process -LRB- as well as an influx of infalling gas -RRB- heats the inter-galactic gas within a cluster to very high temperatures , reaching 30 -- 100 megakelvins .


About 70 -- 80 % of the mass in a cluster is in the form of dark matter , with 10 -- 30 % consisting of this heated gas and the remaining few percent of the matter in the form of galaxies .

Puccini 's indifference to politics caused him problems during World War I. Puccini 's long-standing and close friendship with Toscanini was interrupted for nearly a decade because of an argument in the summer of 1914 -LRB- in the opening months of the war -RRB- during which Puccini remarked that Italy could benefit from German organization .

Honey has the ability to absorb moisture directly from the air , a phenomenon called hygroscopy .


The amount of water the honey absorbs is dependent on the relative humidity of the air .


Because honey contains yeast , this hygroscopic nature requires that honey be stored in sealed containers to prevent fermentation , which usually begins if the honey 's water content rises much above 25 % .


Honey tends to absorb more water in this manner than the individual sugars allow on their own , which may be due to other ingredients it contains .

Humans are dependent on parental help for a large portion of their lifespans compared to other mammals .


Love has therefore been seen as a mechanism to promote parental support of children for this extended time period .

The division was disputed .


Pepin II of Aquitaine -LRB- d. after 864 -RRB- , the emperor 's grandson , rebelled in a contest for Aquitaine , while Louis the German tried to annex all of East Francia .


Louis the Pious died in 840 , with the empire still in chaos .


Jews also spread across Europe during the period .


Communities were established in Germany and England in the 11th and 12th centuries , but Spanish Jews , long settled in Spain under the Muslims , came under Christian rule and increasing pressure to convert to Christianity .

In 1757 , the German hydrologist Albert Brahms empirically observed that the submerged weight of objects that may be carried away by a river is proportional to the sixth power of the river flow speed .


This formulation is also sometimes called Airy 's law .


Thus , if the speed of flow is doubled , the flow would dislodge objects with 64 times as much submerged weight .

The notion of `` prehistory `` began to surface during the Enlightenment in the work of antiquarians who used the word ` primitive ' to describe societies that existed before written records .


The first use of the word prehistory in English , however , occurred in the Foreign Quarterly Review in 1836 .

The British scholar Ronald Latham has pointed out that The Book of Marvels was in fact a collaboration written in 1298 -- 1299 between Polo and a professional writer of romances , Rustichello of Pisa .


Latham also argued that Rustichello may have glamorised Polo 's accounts , and added fantastic and romantic elements that made the book a bestseller .

The Italian scholar Luigi Foscolo Benedetto had previously demonstrated that the book was written in the same `` leisurely , conversational style `` that characterised Rustichello 's other works , and that some passages in the book were taken verbatim or with minimal modifications from other writings by Rustichello .

For example , the opening introduction in The Book of Marvels to `` emperors and kings , dukes and marquises `` was lifted straight out of an Arthurian romance Rustichello had written several years earlier , and the account of the second meeting between Polo and Kublai Khan at the latter 's court is almost the same as that of the arrival of Tristan at the court of King Arthur at Camelot in that same book .

Latham believed that many elements of the book , such as legends of the Middle East and mentions of exotic marvels may have been the work of Rustichello who was giving what medieval European readers expected to find in a travel book .

While the Italian missionary Odoric of Pordenone who visited Yuan China mentioned footbinding -LRB- it is however unclear whether he was merely relaying something he had heard as his description is inaccurate -RRB- , no other foreign visitors to Yuan China mentioned the practice , perhaps an indication that the footbinding was not widespread or was not practiced in an extreme form at that time .

Marco Polo himself noted -LRB- in the Toledo manuscript -RRB- the dainty walk of Chinese women who took very short steps .


It has also been noted by other scholars that many of the things not mentioned by Marco Polo such as tea and chopsticks were n't mentioned by other travelers as well .

Stephen G. Haw , however , challenges this idea that Polo exaggerated his own importance , writing that , `` contrary to what has often been said ... Marco does not claim any very exalted position for himself in the Yuan empire . ``


He points out that Marco never claimed to be a minister of high rank , a darughachi , a leader of a tumen -LRB- i.e . 10,000 men -RRB- , not even the leader of 1,000 men , only that he was an emissary for the khan and held a position of some honor .

Haw sees this as a reasonable claim if Marco was a keshig , who numbered some fourteen thousand at the time .


Haw explains how the earliest manuscripts of Polo 's accounts provide contradicting information about his role in Yangzhou , with some stating he was just a simple resident , others stating he was a governor , and Ramusio 's manuscript claiming he was simply holding that office as a temporary substitute for someone else , yet all the manuscripts concur that he worked as an esteemed emissary for the khan .

Haw also objected to the approach to finding mention of Marco Polo in Chinese texts , contending that contemporaneous Europeans had little regard for using surnames , and a direct Chinese transcription of the name `` Marco `` ignores the possibility of him taking on a Chinese or even Mongol name that had no bearing or similarity with his Latin name .

Some countries run conditional cash transfer welfare programs where payment is conditional on behaviour of the recipients .


Compulsory contraception has been used to prevent future mental illness .


There has been an historical trend among public health professionals to consider targeted programmes .


However identification of high risk groups can increase stigma , in turn meaning that the targeted people do not engage .


Thus current policy recommends universal programs , with resources within such programs weighted towards high risk groups .

Many theories have been proposed as to the origin of the word `` Dubai `` .


One theory suggests the word was used to describe the souq , which was similar to the souq in Ba .


Another theory states that the name came from a word meaning `` money `` , as people from Dubai were commonly believed to be rich due to the thriving trading centre of the location .


An Arabic proverb says `` Daba Dubai `` -LRB- Arabic : دبا دبي -RRB- , meaning `` They came with a lot of money . ``


According to Fedel Handhal , a scholar on the UAE 's history and culture , the word Dubai may have come from the word daba -LRB- Arabic : دبا -RRB- -LRB- a past tense derivative of yadub -LRB- Arabic : يدب -RRB- , which means `` to creep `` -RRB- , referring to the slow flow of Dubai Creek inland .

A culmination point was reached in 2010 with the completion of the Burj Khalifa -LRB- Khalifa Tower -RRB- , now by far the world 's tallest building at 829.8 m -LRB- 2,722 ft -RRB- .


The Burj Khalifa 's design is derived from the patterning systems embodied in Islamic architecture , with the triple-lobed footprint of the building based on an abstracted version of the desert flower hymenocallis which is native to the Dubai region .


The completion of the Khalifa Tower , following the construction boom that began in the 1980s , accelerated in the 1990s , and took on a rapid pace of construction unparalleled in modern human history during the decade of the 2000s , leaves Dubai with the world 's tallest skyline as of 4 January 2010 .

One of the more traditional methods of getting across Bur Dubai to Deira is by abras , small boats that ferry passengers across the Dubai Creek , between abra stations in Bastakiya and Baniyas Road .


The Marine Transport Agency has also implemented the Dubai Water Bus System .


Water bus is a fully air conditioned boat service across selected destinations across the creek .

In February 1265 the newly elected Pope Clement IV summoned Aquinas to Rome to serve as papal theologian .


This same year he was ordered by the Dominican Chapter of Agnani to teach at the studium conventuale at the Roman convent of Santa Sabina , founded some years before , in 1222 .


The studium at Santa Sabina now became an experiment for the Dominicans , the Order 's first studium provinciale , an intermediate school between the studium conventuale and the studium generale .


Prior to this time the Roman Province had offered no specialized education of any sort , no arts , no philosophy ; only simple convent schools , with their basic courses in theology for resident friars , were functioning in Tuscany and the meridionale during the first several decades of the order 's life .

In 1268 the Dominican order assigned Thomas to be regent master at the University of Paris for a second time , a position he held until the spring of 1272 .


Part of the reason for this sudden reassignment appears to have arisen from the rise of `` Averroism `` or `` radical Aristotelianism `` in the universities .


In response to these perceived evils , Thomas wrote two works , one of them being De unitate intellectus , contra Averroistas -LRB- On the Unity of Intellect , against the Averroists -RRB- in which he blasts Averroism as incompatible with Christian doctrine .


During his second regency , he finished the second part of the Summa and wrote De virtutibus and De aeternitate mundi , the latter of which dealt with controversial Averroist and Aristotelian beginninglessness of the world .

His remains were placed in the Church of the Jacobins in Toulouse on 28 January 1369 .


Between 1789 and 1974 , they were held in the Basilique de Saint-Sernin , Toulouse .


In 1974 , they were returned to the Church of the Jacobins , where they have remained ever since .

When Aquinas says that the human body is only partly composed of matter , he means the material body is only potentially a human being .


The soul is what actualizes that potential into an existing human being .


Consequently , the fact that a human body is live human tissue entails that a human soul is wholly present in each part of the human .

On visits to New York City , Chomsky continued to frequent the office of Yiddish anarchist journal Freie Arbeiter Stimme , becoming enamored with the ideas of contributor Rudolf Rocker , whose work introduced him to the link between anarchism and classical liberalism .


Other political thinkers whose work Chomsky read included the anarchist Diego Abad de Santillán , democratic socialists George Orwell , Bertrand Russell , and Dwight Macdonald , and works by Marxists Karl Liebknecht , Karl Korsch , and Rosa Luxemburg .

Although rejecting its Marxist basis , Chomsky was heavily influenced by council communism , voraciously reading articles in Living Marxism written by Antonie Pannekoek .


He was also greatly interested in the Marlenite ideas of the Leninist League , an anti-Stalinist Marxist -- Leninist group , sharing their views that the Second World War was orchestrated by Western capitalists and the Soviet Union 's ` state capitalists ' to crush Europe 's proletariat .

The section of the Upper Rhine downstream from Mainz is also known as the `` Island Rhine `` .


Here a number of river islands occur , locally known as `` Rheinauen `` .

Newcomen 's engine was relatively inefficient .
Newcomen 's engine in most cases was used for pumping water .

It worked by creating a partial vacuum by condensing steam under a piston within a cylinder .


It was employed for draining mine workings at depths hitherto impossible , and also for providing a reusable water supply for driving waterwheels at factories sited away from a suitable `` head `` .


Water that had passed over the wheel was pumped back up into a storage reservoir above the wheel .


Near the end of the 19th century compound engines came into widespread use .


Compound engines exhausted steam in to successively larger cylinders to accommodate the higher volumes at reduced pressures , giving improved efficiency .


These stages were called expansions , with double - and triple-expansion engines being common , especially in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried .

Steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century , when advances in the design of electric motors and internal combustion engines gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating -LRB- piston -RRB- steam engines , with shipping in the 20th-century relying upon the steam turbine .

With two-cylinder compounds used in railway work , the pistons are connected to the cranks as with a two-cylinder simple at 90 ° out of phase with each other -LRB- quartered -RRB- .


When the double-expansion group is duplicated , producing a four-cylinder compound , the individual pistons within the group are usually balanced at 180 ° , the groups being set at 90 ° to each other .

The works of Aristotle that have survived from antiquity through medieval manuscript transmission are collected in the Corpus Aristotelicum .


These texts , as opposed to Aristotle 's lost works , are technical philosophical treatises from within Aristotle 's school .


Reference to them is made according to the organization of Immanuel Bekker 's Royal Prussian Academy edition -LRB- Aristotelis Opera edidit Academia Regia Borussica , Berlin , 1831 -- 1870 -RRB- , which in turn is based on ancient classifications of these works .


Aristotle uses the word `` memory `` for two basic abilities .


First , the actual retaining of the experience in the mnemonic `` imprint `` that can develop from sensation .


Second , the intellectual anxiety that comes with the `` imprint `` due to being impressed at a particular time and processing specific contents .

Some scholars claim that members of Shakespeare 's family were Catholics , at a time when practicing Catholicism in England was against the law .


Shakespeare 's mother , Mary Arden , certainly came from a pious Catholic family .


The strongest evidence might be a Catholic statement of faith signed by his father , John Shakespeare , found in 1757 in the rafters of his former house in Henley Street .


The document is now lost , however , and scholars differ as to its authenticity .

In 1591 , the authorities reported that John Shakespeare had missed church `` for fear of process for debt `` , a common Catholic excuse .


In 1606 , the name of William 's daughter Susanna appears on a list of those who failed to attend Easter communion in Stratford .


As several scholars have noted , whatever his private views , Shakespeare `` conformed to the official state religion `` , as Park Honan put it .


Also , Shakespeare 's will uses a Protestant formula , and he was a confirmed member of the Church of England , where he was married , his children were baptized , and where he is buried .

Understanding this earliest of eras in the history of the universe is currently one of the greatest unsolved problems in physics .


The earliest and most direct observational evidence of the validity of the theory are the expansion of the universe according to Hubble 's law -LRB- as indicated by the redshifts of galaxies -RRB- , discovery and measurement of the cosmic microwave background and the relative abundances of light elements produced by Big Bang nucleosynthesis .

American astronomer Edwin Hubble observed that the distances to faraway galaxies were strongly correlated with their redshifts .


This was interpreted to mean that all distant galaxies and clusters are receding away from our vantage point with an apparent velocity proportional to their distance : that is , the farther they are , the faster they move away from us , regardless of direction .


Assuming the Copernican principle -LRB- that the Earth is not the center of the universe -RRB- , the only remaining interpretation is that all observable regions of the universe are receding from all others .


Since we know that the distance between galaxies increases today , it must mean that in the past galaxies were closer together .


Either we are at the center of an explosion of galaxies -- which is untenable given the Copernican principle -- or the universe is uniformly expanding everywhere .

Either the universe is uniformly expanding everywhere .

This universal expansion was predicted from general relativity by Alexander Friedmann in 1922 and Georges Lemaître in 1927 , well before Hubble made his 1929 analysis and observations , and it remains the cornerstone of the Big Bang theory as developed by Friedmann , Lemaître , Robertson , and Walker .

In early 2003 the first results of the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe -LRB- WMAP -RRB- were released , yielding what were at the time the most accurate values for some of the cosmological parameters .


The results disproved several specific cosmic inflation models , but are consistent with the inflation theory in general .

This led to the idea that up to 90 % of the matter in the universe is dark matter that does not interact with normal baryonic matter .

In addition , the assumption that the universe is mostly normal matter led to predictions that were strongly inconsistent with observations .


While dark matter has always been controversial , it is inferred by various observations : the anisotropies in the CMB , galaxy cluster velocity dispersions , large-scale structure distributions , gravitational lensing studies , and X-ray measurements of galaxy clusters .

The magnetic monopole objection was raised in the late 1970s .


Grand unified theories predicted topological defects in space that would manifest as magnetic monopoles .


These objects would be produced efficiently in the hot early universe , resulting in a density much higher than is consistent with observations , given that no monopoles have been found .


This problem is also resolved by cosmic inflation , which removes all point defects from the observable universe , in the same way that it drives the geometry to flatness .


Brane cosmology models , in which inflation is due to the movement of branes in string theory ; the pre-Big Bang model ; the ekpyrotic model , in which the Big Bang is the result of a collision between branes ; and the cyclic model , a variant of the ekpyrotic model in which collisions occur periodically .

The definitive modern orthography was published in 1946 , just after independence from colonial rule .


In 1948 North Korea attempted to make the script perfectly morphophonemic through the addition of new letters , and in 1953 Syngman Rhee in South Korea attempted to simplify the orthography by returning to the colonial orthography of 1921 , but both reforms were abandoned after only a few years .

The Hunmin Jeong-eum states that King Sejong adapted the 古篆 -LRB- gojeon , `` Gǔ Seal Script `` -RRB- in creating Hangul .


The 古篆 has never been identified .


The primary meaning of 古 gǔ is `` old `` -LRB- `` Old Seal Script `` -RRB- , frustrating philologists because Hangul bears no functional similarity to Chinese 篆字 zhuànzì seal scripts .


However , Ledyard believes 古 gǔ may be a pun on 蒙古 Měnggǔ `` Mongol `` , and that 古篆 is an abbreviation of 蒙古篆字 `` Mongol Seal Script `` , that is , the formal variant of the ` Phags-pa alphabet written to look like the Chinese seal script .

The Ming sporadically sent armed forays into Tibet during the 14th century , which the Tibetans successfully resisted .


Several scholars point out that unlike the preceding Mongols , the Ming dynasty did not garrison permanent troops in Tibet .


The Wanli Emperor -LRB- r. 1572 -- 1620 -RRB- attempted to reestablish Sino-Tibetan relations in the wake of a Mongol-Tibetan alliance initiated in 1578 , an alliance which affected the foreign policy of the subsequent Manchu Qing dynasty -LRB- 1644 -- 1912 -RRB- in their support for the Dalai Lama of the Yellow Hat sect .


By the late 16th century , the Mongols proved to be successful armed protectors of the Yellow Hat Dalai Lama after their increasing presence in the Amdo region , culminating in the conquest of Tibet by Güshi Khan -LRB- 1582 -- 1655 -RRB- in 1642 , establishing the Khoshut Khanate .


While the Yongle Emperor had staged five major offensives north of the Great Wall against the Mongols and the Oirats , the constant threat of Oirat incursions prompted the Ming authorities to fortify the Great Wall from the late 15th century to the 16th century ; nevertheless , John Fairbank notes that `` it proved to be a futile military gesture but vividly expressed China 's siege mentality . ``

Event-causal accounts of incompatibilist free will typically rely upon physicalist models of mind -LRB- like those of the compatibilist -RRB- , yet they presuppose physical indeterminism , in which certain indeterministic events are said to be caused by the agent .


A number of event-causal accounts of free will have been created , referenced here as deliberative indeterminism , centred accounts , and efforts of will theory .

The first two accounts do not require free will to be a fundamental constituent of the universe .


Ordinary randomness is appealed to as supplying the `` elbow room `` that libertarians believe necessary .


A first common objection to event-causal accounts is that the indeterminism could be destructive and could therefore diminish control by the agent rather than provide it -LRB- related to the problem of origination -RRB- .

A second common objection to these models is that it is questionable whether such indeterminism could add any value to deliberation over that which is already present in a deterministic world .


Steiner then argues that inner freedom is achieved when we bridge the gap between our sensory impressions , which reflect the outer appearance of the world , and our thoughts , which give us access to the inner nature of the world .


Acknowledging the many influences on our choice , he points to the impact of our becoming aware of just these determinants .


Outer freedom is attained by permeating our deeds with moral imagination .


Steiner aims to show that these two aspects of inner and outer freedom are integral to one another , and that true freedom is only achieved when they are united .

Pabbata failed to accomplish this task .


Some time later , when Pabbata was sleeping , Chanakya challenged Chandragupta to complete the same task .


Chandragupta retrieved the woolen thread by cutting off Pabbata 's head .


For the next 7 years , Chanakya trained Chandragupta for royal duties .

When Chandragupta became an adult , Chanakya assembled an army .

Chanakya started mixing small doses of poison in the new king 's food to make him immune to poisoning attempts by the enemies .


Chandragupta , who was not aware of this , once shared the food with his pregnant queen , who was seven days away from delivery .


Chanakya arrived just as the queen ate the poisoned morsel .


Realizing that she was going to die , Chanakya decided to save the unborn child .


Over the next seven days , he placed the foetus in the belly of a goat freshly killed each day .


After seven days , Chandragupta 's son was `` born `` .


He was named Bindusara , because his body was spotted with drops -LRB- `` bindu `` -RRB- of goat 's blood .


The Chandragupta-Chanakya legend is mentioned in several commentaries of the Shvetambara canon .


The most well-known version of the Jain legend is contained in the Sthaviravali-Charita or Parishishta-Parvan , written by the 12th century writer Hemachandra .

The rest of Malayaketu 's allies deserted him , disgusted at his treatment of the five slayed allies .


Rakshasa managed to escape , tracked by Chanakya 's spies .


One of Chanakya 's spies , disguised as a friend of Chandana-dasa , got in touch with him .

Capacitors are widely used as parts of electrical circuits in many common electrical devices .


Unlike a resistor , an ideal capacitor does not dissipate energy .


A parallel plate capacitor can only store a finite amount of energy before dielectric breakdown occurs .


The capacitor 's dielectric material has a dielectric strength Ud which sets the capacitor 's breakdown voltage at V = Vbd = Udd .


The maximum energy that the capacitor can store is therefore


Capacitors in a parallel configuration each have the same applied voltage .


Charge is apportioned among them by size .


Using the schematic diagram to visualize parallel plates , it is apparent that each capacitor contributes to the total surface area .


Connected in series , the schematic diagram reveals that the separation distance , not the plate area , adds up .


The total voltage difference from end to end is apportioned to each capacitor according to the inverse of its capacitance .


The entire series acts as a capacitor smaller than any of its components .

Any capacitor containing over 10 joules of energy is generally considered hazardous , while 50 joules or higher is potentially lethal .


A capacitor may regain anywhere from 0.01 to 20 % of its original charge over a period of several minutes , allowing a seemingly safe capacitor to become surprisingly dangerous .


Most capacitors have numbers printed on their bodies to indicate their electrical characteristics .


Larger capacitors like electrolytics usually display the actual capacitance together with the unit , for example , 220 μF .


Smaller capacitors like ceramics , however , use a shorthand-notation consisting of three digits and a letter , where the digits indicate the capacitance in pF , calculated as XY × 10Z for digits XYZ , and the letter indicates the tolerance .

According to the Transneft 's president , numerous meetings with citizens near the lake were held in towns along the route , especially in Irkutsk .


It was not until Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered the company to consider an alternative route 40 kilometers -LRB- 25 mi -RRB- to the north to avoid such ecological risks that Transneft agreed to alter its plans .


Transneft has since decided to move the pipeline away from Lake Baikal , so that it will not pass through any federal or republic natural reserves .

Like Lake Tanganyika , Lake Baikal was formed as an ancient rift valley , having the typical long crescent shape with a surface area of 31,722 km2 -LRB- 12,248 sq mi -RRB- .


Baikal is home to thousands of species of plants and animals , many of which exist nowhere else in the world .

The response curve as a function of wavelength varies for each type of cone .


Because the curves overlap , some tristimulus values do not occur for any incoming light combination .


For example , it is not possible to stimulate only the mid-wavelength -LRB- so-called `` green `` -RRB- cones ; the other cones will inevitably be stimulated to some degree at the same time .


The set of all possible tristimulus values determines the human color space .


It has been estimated that humans can distinguish roughly 10 million different colors .


While most humans are trichromatic -LRB- having three types of color receptors -RRB- , many animals , known as tetrachromats , have four types .


These include some species of spiders , most marsupials , birds , reptiles , and many species of fish .

A distinction is made between retinal tetrachromacy -LRB- having four pigments in cone cells in the retina , compared to three in trichromats -RRB- and functional tetrachromacy -LRB- having the ability to make enhanced color discriminations based on that retinal difference -RRB- .


The phenomenon arises when an individual receives two slightly different copies of the gene for either the medium - or long-wavelength cones , which are carried on the x-chromosome .

To have two different genes , a person must have two x-chromosomes , which is why the phenomenon only occurs in women .


There is one scholarly report that confirms the existence of a functional tetrachromat .


Similarly , most human color perceptions can be generated by a mixture of three colors called primaries .

The city was recently named as the most entrepreneurial city in South Africa , with the percentage of Capetonians pursuing business opportunities almost three times higher than the national average .


Those aged between 18 and 64 were 190 % more likely to pursue new business , whilst in Johannesburg , the same demographic group was only 60 % more likely than the national average to pursue a new business .


In 1652 , Jan van Riebeeck and other employees of the Dutch East India Company -LRB- Dutch : Verenigde Oost-indische Compagnie , VOC -RRB- were sent to the Cape to establish a way-station for ships travelling to the Dutch East Indies , and the Fort de Goede Hoop -LRB- later replaced by the Castle of Good Hope -RRB- .

The conservative movement of the 1950s attempted to bring together these divergent strands , stressing the need for unity to prevent the spread of `` Godless Communism `` , which Reagan later labeled an `` evil empire `` .


During the Reagan administration , conservatives also supported the so-called `` Reagan Doctrine `` under which the US , as part of a Cold War strategy , provided military and other support to guerrilla insurgencies that were fighting governments identified as socialist or communist .

A 1996 study on the relationship between racism and conservatism found that the correlation was stronger among more educated individuals , though `` anti-Black affect had essentially no relationship with political conservatism at any level of educational or intellectual sophistication `` .


They also found that the correlation between racism and conservatism could be entirely accounted for by their mutual relationship with social dominance orientation .


Many legumes , however , are deficient in the essential amino acid methionine , which grains contain .


Thus , a combination of legumes with grains forms a well-balanced diet for vegetarians .


Common examples of such combinations are dal -LRB- lentils -RRB- with rice by South Indians and Bengalis , dal with wheat in Pakistan and North India , and beans with corn tortillas , tofu with rice , and peanut butter with wheat bread -LRB- as sandwiches -RRB- in several other cultures , including Americans .

Helpless at birth , humans continue to grow for some years , typically reaching sexual maturity at 12 to 15 years of age .


Females continue to develop physically until around the age of 18 , whereas male development continues until around age 21 .

Compared to other primates , humans experience an unusually rapid growth spurt during adolescence , where the body grows 25 % in size .


Chimpanzees , for example , grow only 14 % , with no pronounced spurt .


The presence of the growth spurt is probably necessary to keep children physically small until they are psychologically mature .


Humans are one of the few species in which females undergo menopause .

First , the Dominican theologian Sylvester Mazzolini drafted a heresy case against Luther , whom Leo then summoned to Rome .


The Elector Frederick persuaded the pope to have Luther examined at Augsburg , where the Imperial Diet was held .


There , over a three-day period in October 1518 , Luther defended himself under questioning by papal legate Cardinal Cajetan .


The Pope 's right to issue indulgences was at the centre of the dispute between the two men .


The hearings degenerated into a shouting match .


More than writing his theses , Luther 's confrontation with the church cast him as an enemy of the pope .


Cajetan 's original instructions had been to arrest Luther if he failed to recant , but the legate desisted from doing so .

Luther slipped out of the city at night , unbeknownst to Cajetan .


In January 1519 , at Altenburg in Saxony , the papal nuncio Karl von Miltitz adopted a more conciliatory approach .


Luther made certain concessions to the Saxon , who was a relative of the Elector , and promised to remain silent if his opponents did .

The United Kingdom 's Slave Trade Act 1807 banned the trade across the British Empire , which was enforced internationally by the Royal Navy under treaties Britain negotiated with other nations .


As the voting franchise in the U.K. was increased , it also was made more uniform in a series of reforms beginning with the Reform Act 1832 .


In 1833 , the United Kingdom passed the Slavery Abolition Act which took effect across the British Empire .


In some countries , notably in the United Kingdom which originated the Westminster system , the dominant principle is that of parliamentary sovereignty , while maintaining judicial independence .


In the United States , separation of powers is often cited as a central attribute .


In India , parliamentary sovereignty is subject to the Constitution of India which includes judicial review .


Though the term `` democracy `` is typically used in the context of a political state , the principles also are applicable to private organisations .


Majority rule is often listed as a characteristic of democracy .

Different variants of aggregative democracy exist .


Under minimalism , democracy is a system of government in which citizens have given teams of political leaders the right to rule in periodic elections .

Some economists have criticized the efficiency of democracy , citing the premise of a voter who makes decisions without all of necessary information in order to make a truly informed decision .

Another argument is that democracy slows down processes because of the amount of input and participation needed in order to go forward with a decision .


A common example often quoted to substantiate this point is the high economic development achieved by China -LRB- a non-democratic country -RRB- as compared to India -LRB- a democratic country -RRB- .


According to economists , the lack of democratic participation in countries like China allows for unfettered economic growth .


In a diode formed from a direct band-gap semiconductor , such as gallium arsenide , charge carriers that cross the junction emit photons when they recombine with the majority carrier on the other side .


Depending on the material , wavelengths -LRB- or colors -RRB- from the infrared to the near ultraviolet may be produced .

Enzymes are generally globular proteins , acting in larger complexes .

Like all proteins , enzymes are linear chains of amino acids that fold to produce a three-dimensional structure .


The sequence of the amino acids specifies the structure which in turn determines the catalytic activity of the enzyme .


Although structure determines function , a novel enzyme 's activity can not yet be predicted from its structure alone .


Enzyme structures unfold -LRB- denature -RRB- when heated or exposed to chemical denaturants and this disruption to the structure typically causes a loss of activity .

Allosteric sites are pockets on the enzyme , distinct from the active site , that bind to molecules in the cellular environment .


These molecules then cause a change in the conformation or dynamics of the enzyme that is transduced to the active site and thus affects the reaction rate of the enzyme .

Several enzymes can work together in a specific order , creating metabolic pathways .


In a metabolic pathway , one enzyme takes the product of another enzyme as a substrate .


After the catalytic reaction , the product is then passed on to another enzyme .


Sometimes more than one enzyme can catalyze the same reaction in parallel ; this can allow more complex regulation : with , for example , a low constant activity provided by one enzyme but an inducible high activity from a second enzyme .

The scientific method is a set of steps that help us to answer questions .


When we use logical steps and control the number of things that can be changed , we get better answers .
When we use logical steps , we get better answers .
When we control the number of things that can be changed , we get better answers .

The basic sequence of steps followed in the scientific method is illustrated in Figure 1.1 .


Asking a question is one really good way to begin to learn about the natural world .


You might have seen something that makes you curious .


You might want to know what to change to produce a better result .


Lets say a farmer is having an erosion problem .


The farmer learns that a farming method called no-till farming allows farmers to plant seeds without plowing the land .


She wonders if planting seeds without plowing will reduce the erosion problem and help keep more soil on her farmland .
She wonders if planting seeds without plowing will reduce the erosion problem .
She wonders if planting seeds without plowing will help keep more soil on her farmland .

Her question is this : Will using the no-till method of farming help me to lose less soil on my farm ?


Before she begins , the farmer needs to learn more about this farming method .


A good way for her to learn is to talk to people who have tried this way of farming .


Farming machines are shown in the Figure 1.3 .


When we design experiments , we choose just one thing to change .


The thing we change is called the independent variable .


The farmer measures how much soil is lost from each field .


How much soil is lost from each field depends on the plowing method .


In the example , the farmer chooses two fields and then changes only one thing between them .
In the example , the farmer chooses two fields .
In the example , the farmer then changes only one thing between them .

One field will be tilled and one will not .
One field will be tilled .
one will not .

The fields should be facing the same direction to get about the same amount of sunlight .


If the farmer only changes how she plows her fields , she can see the impact of the one change .


After the experiment is complete , scientists then measure the result .


During an experiment , a scientist collects data .


The data might be measurements , like the farmer is taking in Figure labeled .


For example , an electronic balance may always measure one gram high .


To fix this , the balance should be adjusted .


If it cant be adjusted , each measurement should be corrected .


A mistake can come if a measurement is hard to make .


For example , the scientist may stop a stopwatch too soon or too late .
For example , the scientist may stop a stopwatch too soon .
For example , the scientist may stop a stopwatch too late .

To fix this , the scientist should run the experiment many times and make many measurements .

It is likely a mistake was made in that experiment .


Labeling helps the scientist to know what each number represents .


A scientist may also write descriptions of what happened during the experiment .


The scientist may create a graph or drawing to show the data .
The scientist may create a graph to show the data .
The scientist may create a drawing to show the data .

If the scientist can picture the data the results may be easier to understand .


Then it is easier to draw logical conclusions .


Even if the scientist is really careful it is possible to make a mistake .


The scientist must next form a conclusion .


The scientist must study all of the data .


Even a disproved hypothesis can lead to new questions .


The farmer grows crops on the two fields for a season .


She finds that 2.2 times as much soil was lost on the plowed field as compared to the unplowed field .


The soil moisture seems higher .


This time she will measure soil moisture , plant growth , and the total amount of water the plants consume .
This time she will measure soil moisture .
This time she will measure plant growth .
This time she will measure the total amount of water the plants consume .

What statement best explains the data ?


She will also research other factors that may reduce soil erosion .


Did the experiment prove the hypothesis ?


Sometimes an experiment shows that a hypothesis is correct .


Other times the data disproves the hypothesis .


If there is no conclusion , the scientist may test the hypothesis again .


No matter what the experiment shows the scientist has learned something .


The hypothesis then becomes a theory .


Sometimes people say they have a theory when what they have is a hypothesis .


In science , a theory has been repeatedly shown to be true .


A theory is supported by many observations .


However , a theory may be disproved if conflicting data is discovered .


Many important theories have been shown to be true by many observations and experiments and are extremely unlikely to be disproved .
Many important theories are extremely unlikely to be disproved .

These include the theory of evolution .

Before the paper is printed , other scientists look at it to try to find mistakes .


They see if the conclusions follow from the data .


This is called peer review .


Other papers are published on the same topic in the journal .


The evidence for or against a hypothesis is discussed by many scientists .

For example , Earths climate depends on an enormous number of factors .


Climate models can predict how climate will change as certain gases are added to the atmosphere .


To test how good a model is , scientists might start a test run at a time in the past .


If the model can predict the present it is probably a good model .

Wind carries particles of different sizes in the same ways that water carries them .


They may be carried great distances and rise high above the ground .


Did you ever see workers sandblasting a building to clean it ?


Sand is blown onto the surface to scour away dirt and debris .
Sand is blown onto the surface to scour away dirt .
Sand is blown onto the surface to scour away debris .

Wind-blown sand may carve rocks into interesting shapes .


You can see an example in Figure 10.22 .


This form of erosion is called abrasion .


It occurs any time rough sediments are blown or dragged over surfaces .
It occurs any time rough sediments are blown over surfaces .
It occurs any time rough sediments are dragged over surfaces .

Can you think of other ways abrasion might occur ?


Like water , when wind slows down it drops the sediment its carrying .


This often happens when the wind has to move over or around an obstacle .

A rock or tree may cause wind to slow down .
A rock may cause wind to slow down .
A tree may cause wind to slow down .

As the wind slows , it deposits the largest particles first .


Different types of deposits form depending on the size of the particles deposited .


These hills are called sand dunes .


For sand dunes to form , there must be plenty of sand and wind .
For sand dunes to form , there must be plenty of sand .
For sand dunes to form , there must be plenty of wind .

Sand dunes are found mainly in deserts and on beaches .

Sand dunes are found mainly on beaches .

What causes a sand dune to form ?


The obstacle causes the wind to slow down .


The wind then drops some of its sand .


As more sand is deposited , the dune gets bigger .


The dune becomes the obstacle that slows the wind and causes it to drop its sand .
The dune becomes the obstacle that slows the wind .
The dune becomes the obstacle that causes it to drop its sand .

The hill takes on the typical shape of a sand dune , shown in Figure 10.24 .


Once a sand dune forms , it may slowly migrate over the land .


The wind moves grains of sand up the gently sloping side of the dune .


When the sand grains reach the top of the dune , they slip down the steeper side .


The grains are pulled by gravity .


The constant movement of sand up and over the dune causes the dune to move along the ground .
The constant movement of sand up the dune causes the dune to move along the ground .
The constant movement of sand over the dune causes the dune to move along the ground .

When the wind drops fine particles of silt and clay , it forms deposits called loess .
When the wind drops fine particles of silt , it forms deposits called loess .
When the wind drops fine particles of clay , it forms deposits called loess .

Loess deposits form vertical cliffs .


Loess can become a thick , rich soil .


Thats why loess deposits are used for farming in many parts of the world .


Its very important to control wind erosion of soil .


Good soil is a precious resource that takes a long time to form .


Covering soil with plants is one way to reduce wind erosion .


Plants and their roots help hold the soil in place .
Plants help hold the soil in place .
their roots help hold the soil in place .

They also help the soil retain water so it is less likely to blow away .


Planting rows of trees around fields is another way to reduce wind erosion .


The trees slow down the wind , so it doesnt cause as much erosion .


Fences like the one in Figure 10.26 serve the same purpose .


The fence in the figure is preventing erosion and migration of sand dunes on a beach .

Each organism has the ability to survive in a specific environment .


Dry desert environments are difficult to live in .


When the droplet is heavy enough , it slides forward .


There are many other environments that need unique approaches for survival -LRB- Figure 12.10 -RRB- .

Hummingbirds have long , thin beaks that help them drink nectar from flowers .


Some flowers are tubular to fit hummingbird beaks .


The battle between needing food and being food plays out in the drama between lions and zebras .


When a herd of zebras senses a lion , the animals run away .


The zebras dark stripes confuse the lions .


It becomes hard for them to focus on just one zebra .


The zebras may get away .


A lion may be able to get a zebra , maybe one thats old or sick .

A lion may be able to get a zebra , maybe one thats sick .

Hair color is a trait determined by genes .


At some point , the variation probably came from a mutation .


If the trait from the mutation is beneficial , that organism may have a better chance to survive .


An organism that survives is likely to have offspring .


If it does , it may pass the mutation on to its offspring .


The offspring may be more likely to survive .


Some of the characteristics an organism has may help it survive .


These characteristics are called adaptations .


The trees may pass on the favorable mutation to their offspring .


The other trees will die .


Eventually , the population of oak trees will change .


Most of the trees will have the trait to survive the fungus .


Over time , traits that help an organism survive become more common .


Traits that hinder survival eventually disappear .


Adaptations develop this way .


Think about a population of oak trees .


Imagine that a fungus has arrived from Asia to North America .


But a few oak trees have a mutation that allows them to survive the fungus .


Those oak trees are better adapted to the new environment than the others .


Those trees have a better chance of surviving .


Adaptations in a species add up .


We can learn about this from fossils .


The horses teeth and hooves have also changed .
The horses teeth have also changed .
The horses hooves have also changed .

The horses evolved because of changes in their environment .


But if the environment is changing , the species will need to adapt .


In time , the species may change a lot .


This process is called evolution .


Evolution happens as a species changes over time .


Organisms alive today evolved from earlier life forms .


Most of the organisms that once lived on Earth are now extinct .


Earths environment has changed many times .


Many organisms could not adapt to the changes .


The organisms that did survive passed traits on to their offspring .


The changes added up , eventually producing the species we see today .


We study fossils to see the organisms that lived at certain times .


We can see how those organisms changed with time .


The Phanerozoic Eon is divided into three eras the Paleozoic , the Mesozoic , and the Cenozoic -LRB- Table 12.1 -RRB- .

They span from about 540 million years ago to the present .


Earths climate changed numerous times during the Phanerozoic Eon .


Just before the beginning of the Phanerozoic Eon , much of the Earth was covered with glaciers .


As the Phanerozoic Eon began , the climate became a warm and humid tropical climate .
As the Phanerozoic Eon began , the climate became a warm tropical climate .

During the Phanerozoic , Earths climate has gone through at least 4 major cycles between times of cold glaciers and times of warm tropical seas .


Some organisms survived environmental changes in the climate ; others became extinct when the climate changed beyond their capacity to cope with it .

By the beginning of the Paleozoic , organisms had developed shells .


Shells could hold their soft tissues together .


Some organisms evolved external skeletons , called exoskeletons .


Organisms with hard parts also make good fossils .


There was much more diversity , so complex ecosystems could develop -LRB- Figure 12.14 -RRB- .

It also does not need to be protected against drying out .


Moving from the seas to land required many adaptations .


Algae had covered moist land areas for millions of years .


By about 450 million years ago , plants began to appear on land .


To move to land , animals needed strong skeletons .

The eras of the Phanerozoic Eon are separated by mass extinctions .


During these events , large numbers of organisms became extinct very rapidly .


There have been several extinctions in the Phanerozoic but two stand out more than the others .
There have been several extinctions in the Phanerozoic .
two stand out more than the others .

Between the Paleozoic Era and the Mesozoic Era was the largest mass extinction known .


At the end of the Permian , nearly 95 % of all marine species died off .


In addition , 70 % of land species became extinct .


No one knows the cause of this extinction .


Some scientists blame an asteroid impact .


Other scientists think it was a gigantic volcanic eruption .


Between the Mesozoic Era and the Cenozoic Era , about 50 % of all animal species died off .


The rain dissolved the shells of the tiny marine plankton that form the base of the food chain .


With little food being produced , animals starved .


This mass extinction is when the dinosaurs became extinct .


Most scientists think that the extinction was caused by a giant meteorite that struck Earth .


The impact heated the atmosphere until it became as hot as a kitchen oven .


Dust flew into the atmosphere and blocked sunlight for a year or more .

Air movement takes place in the troposphere .


The sinking , heavy air creates an area of high air pressure near the ground .


Air always flows from an area of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure .


Air flowing over Earths surface is called wind .


Air moves because of differences in heating .


These differences create convection currents and winds .
These differences create convection currents .
These differences create winds .

Figure 15.19 shows how this happens .


The light , rising air creates an area of low air pressure at the surface .


The rising air cools as it reaches the top of the troposphere .


The air gets denser , so it sinks to the surface .


Local winds are winds that blow over a limited area .


They are influenced by local geography .


Nearness to an ocean , lake or mountain range can affect local winds .
Nearness to an ocean can affect local winds .

The hot air carries it over the land .

Summer monsoons bring heavy rains on land .


Monsoons occur in several places around the globe .


The most important monsoon in the world is in southern Asia , as shown in Figure 15.21 .


These monsoons are important because they carry water to the many people who live there .


Global winds are winds that occur in belts that go all around the planet .


Like local winds , global winds are caused by unequal heating of the atmosphere .


Earth is hottest at the equator and gets cooler toward the poles .
Earth is hottest at the equator .
Earth gets cooler toward the poles .

The differences in heating create huge convection currents in the troposphere .


At the equator , for example , warm air rises up to the tropopause .


By the time the moving air reaches 30 N or S latitude , it has cooled .
By the time the moving air reaches 30 N latitude , it has cooled .
By the time the moving air reaches 30 S latitude , it has cooled .

The cool air sinks to the surface .


Other global winds occur in much the same way .


Earth is spinning as air moves over its surface .


This causes the Coriolis effect .


Winds blow on a diagonal over the surface , instead of due north or south .
Winds blow on a diagonal over the surface , instead of due north .

The conditions in an air mass depend on where the air mass formed .


Most air masses form over polar or tropical regions .
Most air masses form over polar regions .
Most air masses form over tropical regions .

Air masses are moist if they form over oceans .


Air masses that form over oceans are called maritime air masses .


Those that form over continents are called continental air masses .


Figure 16.6 shows air masses that form over or near North America .
Figure 16.6 shows air masses that form over North America .
Figure 16.6 shows air masses that form near North America .

An air mass takes on the conditions of the area where it forms .


When a new air mass goes over a region it brings its characteristics to the region .


This may change the areas temperature and humidity .
This may change the areas temperature .
This may change the areas humidity .

Moving air masses cause the weather to change when they contact different conditions .


For example , a warm air mass moving over cold ground may cause an inversion .


Why do air masses move ?


Winds and jet streams push them along .
Winds push them along .
jet streams push them along .

Cold air masses tend to move toward the equator .


Warm air masses tend to move toward the poles .


Coriolis effect causes them to move on a diagonal .


Many air masses move toward the northeast over the U.S .


When cold air masses move south from the poles , they run into warm air masses moving north from the tropics .


The boundary between two air masses is called a front .


The differences in temperature and pressure cause clouds and precipitation .
The differences in temperature cause clouds .

Types of fronts include cold , warm , occluded , and stationary fronts .
Types of fronts include cold fronts .

Types of fronts include occluded fronts .
Types of fronts include stationary fronts .

A cold front occurs when a cold air mass runs into a warm air mass .


This is shown in Figure 16.7 .


There may be a thin line of storms right at the front that moves as it moves .


In the late fall and winter , snow storms may occur .
In the late fall , snow storms may occur .
In the winter , snow storms may occur .

After a cold front passes , the cold air mass behind it brings cooler temperatures .


The cold air mass moves faster than the warm air mass and lifts the warm air mass out of its way .
The cold air mass moves faster than the warm air mass .
The cold air mass lifts the warm air mass out of its way .

As the warm air rises , its water vapor condenses .


Clouds form , and precipitation falls .

pressure differences between the two air masses cause winds .

As the fast-moving cold air mass keeps advancing , so does the cold front .


Cold fronts often bring sudden changes in the weather .


When a warm air mass runs into a cold air mass it creates a warm front .


This is shown in Figure 16.8 .


The warm air mass is moving faster than the cold air mass , so it flows up over the cold air mass .


Warm fronts move slowly and cover a wide area .
Warm fronts move slowly .
Warm fronts cover a wide area .

After a warm front passes , the warm air mass behind it brings warmer temperatures .


With an occluded front , a warm air mass becomes trapped between two cold air masses .


The warm air is lifted up above the cold air as in Figure 16.9 .


Sometimes two air masses stop moving when they meet .


These stalled air masses create a stationary front .


Such a front may bring clouds and precipitation to the same area for many days .
Such a front may bring clouds to the same area for many days .
Such a front may bring precipitation to the same area for many days .

Cold air is dense , so it sinks .


This creates a center of high pressure .


Both are shown in Figure 16.10 .


A cyclone is a system of winds that rotates around a center of low pressure .


Cyclones bring cloudy , wet weather .


An anticyclone is a system of winds that rotates around a center of high pressure .


Anticyclones bring fair , dry weather .


Warm air is less dense so it rises .


This creates a center of low pressure .


Air always flows from higher to lower pressure .


As the air flows , Earths surface rotates below it causing Coriolis effect .


This wind pattern forms a cyclone .


The same happens while the wind blows out of a high pressure .


This forms an anticyclone .


A storm is an episode of severe weather caused by a major disturbance in the atmosphere .


Storms can vary a lot in the time they last and in how severe they are .

Thunderstorms occur when the air is very warm and humid .
Thunderstorms occur when the air is very warm .
Thunderstorms occur when the air is very humid .

The warm air rises rapidly to create strong updrafts .


When the rising air cools , its water vapor condenses .


The updrafts create tall cumulonimbus clouds called thunder - heads .


During a thunderstorm , some parts of a thunderhead become negatively charged .


Other parts become positively charged .


The difference in charge creates lightning .


Lightning can jump between oppositely charged parts of the same cloud , between one cloud and another , or between a cloud and the ground .

The funnel moves along the ground , destroying everything in its path .


Before this happens it may have gone up to 25 kilometers -LRB- 16 miles -RRB- .


The winds of a tornado can reach very high speeds .


The faster the winds blow , the greater the damage they cause .


Wind speed and damage are used to classify tornadoes .

Look at the map in Figure 16.15 .


It shows where the greatest number of tornadoes occur in the U.S. Tornadoes can happen almost anywhere in the U.S. but only this area is called tornado alley .

Why do so many tornadoes occur here ?


Tornadoes may also come from hurricanes .


The storm then loses strength and slowly fades away .

Hurricanes develop from tropical cyclones .


Hurricanes form over warm very ocean water .


This water gives them their energy .


As long as a hurricane stays over the warm ocean , it keeps growing stronger .


Like tornadoes , hurricanes are classified on the basis of wind speed and damage .
Like tornadoes , hurricanes are classified on the basis of wind speed .
Like tornadoes , hurricanes are classified on the basis of damage .

Some of the damage from a hurricane is caused by storm surge .


The very low pressure of the eye allows the water level to rise above normal sea level .


Storm surge can cause flooding when it reaches land .


High winds can also create very big waves .


If the storm happens to occur at high tide , the water will rise even higher .


Like hurricanes , winter storms develop from cyclones .


But in the case of winter storms , the cyclones form at higher latitudes .


In North America , cyclones often form when the jet stream dips south in the winter .


This lets dry polar air pour south .


At the same time , warm moist air from the Gulf of Mexico flows north .

Higher windchill will cause a person to suffer frostbite sooner than if the wind isnt blowing .
Higher windchill will cause a person to suffer other harmful effects of cold sooner than if the wind isnt blowing .

The wind may blow the snow into deep drifts .


Along with the poor visibility , the snow drifts make driving risky .


The wind also makes cold temperatures more dangerous .


Windchill is what the temperature feels like when the wind is taken into account .


Some places receive very heavy snowfall just about every winter .


Figure 16.20 shows how lake-effect snow occurs .


Winter winds pick up moisture as they pass over the relatively warm waters of a large lake .


When the winds reach the cold land on the other side , the air cools .


More than 254 centimeters -LRB- 100 inches -RRB- of snow may fall in a single lake-effect storm !


Weather is very difficult to predict .


Thats because its very complex and many factors are involved .
Thats because its very complex are involved .
Thats because many factors are involved .

Still , certain rules of thumb generally apply .


These rules help meteorologists forecast the weather .


For example , low pressure is likely to bring stormy weather .


So if a center of low pressure is moving your way , you can expect a storm .


Predicting the weather requires a lot of weather data .


Technology is used to gather the data and computers are used to analyze the data .

computers are used to analyze the data .

Using this information gives meteorologists the best chance of predicting the weather .


Weather instruments measure weather conditions .


One of the most important conditions is air pressure , which is measured with a barometer .


Figure 16.23 shows how a barometer works .


There are also a number of other commonly used weather instruments -LRB- see Figure 16.24 -RRB- : A thermometer measures temperature .


An anemometer measures wind speed .


A rain gauge measures the amount of rain .


A hygrometer measures humidity .


A wind vane shows wind direction .


A snow gauge measures the amount of snow .


Weather instruments collect data from all over the world at thousands of weather stations .


You can see what a weather station looks like in Figure 16.25 .


Other weather devices are needed to collect weather data in the atmosphere .


Weather stations contain many instruments for measuring weather conditions .


What do meteorologists do with all that weather data ?


The models analyze the data and predict the weather .

Some weather maps show many weather conditions .


Others show a single condition .


The lines on the map connect places that have the same air pressure .


Air pressure is measured in a unit called the millibar .


Isobars are the lines that connect the points with the same air pressure .


The map also shows low - and high-pressure centers and fronts .

It includes average temperatures .


What determines the climate of a place ?


A nearby ocean or mountain range can also play a role .
A nearby ocean can also play a role .

Its measured in degrees , from 0 to 90 .


Several climate factors vary with latitude .

Global air currents affect precipitation .


How they affect it varies with latitude .


You can see why in Figure 17.3 .


Global air currents cause global winds .


Figure 17.4 shows the direction that these winds blow .


Global winds are the prevailing , or usual , winds at a given latitude .
Global winds are the prevailing , winds at a given latitude .
Global winds are the usual , winds at a given latitude .

The winds move air masses , which causes weather .


The direction of prevailing winds determines which type of air mass usually moves over an area .


For example , a west wind might bring warm moist air from over an ocean .


An east wind might bring cold dry air from over a mountain range .


Which wind prevails has a big effect on the climate .


What if the prevailing winds are westerlies ?


On the coast , the climate is influenced by warm moist air from the ocean .


Farther inland , the climate is influenced by cold or hot air from the land .

Just having a mountain range nearby can affect the climate .


Air temperature falls at higher altitudes .


Why does this happen ?


Since air is less dense at higher altitudes , its molecules are spread farther apart than they are at sea level .


These molecules have fewer collisions , so they produce less heat .


Look at the mountain in Figure 17.7 .


Mountains can also affect precipitation .


Mountains and mountain ranges can cast a rain shadow .
Mountains can cast a rain shadow .

Many different species live together in an ecosystem .


All their populations make up a community .

All ecosystems have living things that play the same basic roles .


Producers are living things that use energy to make food .


Producers make food for themselves and other living things .
Producers make food for themselves .
Producers make food for other living things .

These producers live deep under the ocean where there is no sunlight .


There are two types of producers : By far the most common producers use the energy in sunlight to make food .


This is called photosynthesis .


Producers that photosynthesize include plants and algae .
Producers that photosynthesize include plants .
Producers that photosynthesize include algae .

These organisms must live where there is plenty of sunlight .


Other producers use the energy in chemicals to make food .


This is called chemosynthesis .


Consumers cant make their own food .


Consumers must eat producers or other consumers .
Consumers must eat producers .
Consumers must eat other consumers .

Scavengers eat animals that are already dead .

The mushrooms pictured are growing on a dead log .


This releases its nutrients to the soil .


Figure 18.5 lists the three main types of consumers .


Consumers get their food in different ways Figure 18.6 .


Grazers feed on living organisms without killing them .

All living things need energy .


For example , it takes energy to grow .


It also takes energy to produce offspring .


In fact , it takes energy just to stay alive .


Remember that energy cant be created or destroyed .
Remember that energy cant be created .
Remember that energy cant be destroyed .

Energy changes form as it moves through ecosystems .


Most ecosystems get their energy from the Sun .


Only producers can use sunlight to make usable energy .


Producers convert the sunlight into chemical energy or food .
Producers convert the sunlight into chemical energy .
Producers convert the sunlight into food .

Consumers get some of that energy when they eat producers .


In this way , energy flows from one living thing to another .


A food chain is a simple diagram that shows one way energy flows through an ecosystem .


Some energy goes into animal wastes .


Energy also goes into growing things that another consumer cant eat , like fur .


Its because so much energy is lost that most food chains have just a few levels .


Theres not enough energy left for higher levels .


Producers form the base of all food chains .


The consumers that eat producers are called primary consumers .


The consumers that eat primary consumers are secondary consumers .


This chain can continue to multiple levels .


At each level of a food chain , a lot of energy is lost .


Only about 10 percent of the energy passes to the next level .


Where does that energy go ?


Some energy is given off as heat .


Food chains are too simple to represent the real world .


They dont show all the ways that energy flows through an ecosystem .


A more complex diagram is called a food web .


A food web consists of many overlapping food chains .


How many food chains include the mouse ?


Living things need nonliving matter as well as energy .


What do you think matter is used for ?


The nutrients pass to primary consumers when they eat the plants .


The nutrients pass to higher level consumers when they eat lower level consumers .


When living things die , the cycle repeats .


One thing is to build bodies .


Any nonliving matter that living things need is called a nutrient .


Unlike energy , matter is recycled in ecosystems .


You can see how in Figure 18.9 .


Decomposers release nutrients when they break down dead organisms .


The nutrients are taken up by plants through their roots .

What does an air mass with the symbol cPk mean ?


The symbol cPk is an air mass with a continental polar source region that is colder than the region it is now moving over .


Air masses are slowly pushed along by high-level winds .

Thermometers measure temperature .


In an old-style mercury thermometer , mercury is placed in a long , very narrow tube with a bulb .


A scale on the outside of the thermometer matches up with the air temperature .

A maritime climate is strongly influenced by the nearby sea .


Why is the climate there less influenced by the ocean than is the climate in San Francisco ?


Hint : Think about the direction the winds are going at that latitude .


The weather in San Francisco comes from over the Pacific Ocean while much of the weather in Virginia comes from the continent .


How does the ocean influence the climate of these three cities ?


Temperatures vary a relatively small amount seasonally and daily .


For a location to have a true maritime climate , the winds must most frequently come off the sea .


The oceans influence in moderating climate can be seen in the following temperature comparisons .


The climate of San Francisco is influenced by the cool California current and offshore upwelling .
The climate of San Francisco is influenced by the cool California current .
The climate of San Francisco is influenced by offshore upwelling .

The temperature of the water offshore influences the temperature of a coastal location , particularly if the winds come off the sea .


The cool waters of the California Current bring cooler temperatures to the California coastal region .


Coastal upwelling also brings cold , deep water up to the ocean surface off of California , which contributes to the cool coastal temperatures .


Further north , in southern Alaska , the upwelling actually raises the temperature of the surrounding land because the ocean water is much warmer than the land .


The important effect of the Gulf Stream on the climate of northern Europe is described in the chapter Water on Earth .

Different types of pollutants cause different types of harm .


Particulates reduce visibility .


In the East , people can only see about 40 to 60 kilometers -LRB- 25-35 miles -RRB- , about one-fifth the distance they could see without any air pollution -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- .


Particulates reduce the amount of sunshine that reaches the ground , which may reduce photosynthesis .

By reducing sunshine , particulates can also alter air temperature as mentioned above .


Imagine how much all of the sources of particulates combine to reduce temperatures .


Ozone damages some plants .


Since ozone effects accumulate , plants that live a long time show the most damage .


Some species of trees appear to be the most susceptible .

Scientific theories are sometimes thrown out when the data shows them to be wrong .


Before plate tectonics theory was accepted , people thought that fossil organisms had spread around using land bridges .


Although a land bridge across the Atlantic seemed a bit far-fetched , there was no better idea .


Most scientists were relieved when they could toss that theory out .


But some theories account for so many phenomena and are so broadly supported by so many lines of evidence that they are unlikely ever to be disproved .

We know that average global tempera - tures are rising .


This idea will be explored in detail in later concepts .


We even know why : Carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere when fossil fuels are burned .


This is like putting an extra blanket over Earth .


Since more heat is being trapped , global temperature is rising .


There is very little information that contradicts the theory that climate is changing due in large part to human activities .


Unless some major discrepancy is discovered about how the atmosphere works , the theory is very likely to stand .


So far , the evidence that is being collected supports the idea and global warming can be used to predict future events , which are already taking place .

Most of the species that have lived have also gone extinct .


There are two ways to go extinct : besides the obvious way of dying out completely , a species goes extinct if it evolves into a different species .


The causes of different mass extinctions are different : collisions with comets or asteroids , massive volcanic eruptions , or rapidly changing climate are all possible causes of some of these disasters -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- .

After a mass extinction , many habitats are no longer inhabited by organisms because they have gone extinct .


With new habitats available , some species will adapt to the new environments .

The process in which many new species evolve in a short period of time to fill available niches is called adaptive radiation .

For example , after the extinction of the dinosaurs , mammals underwent adaptive radiation and became the dominant life form .

Global winds blow in belts encircling the planet .


Notice that the locations of these wind belts correlate with the atmospheric circulation cells .


Air blowing at the base of the circulation cells , from high pressure to low pressure , creates the global wind belts .


In the Hadley cell air should move north to south , but it is deflected to the right by Coriolis .


This belt is the trade winds , so called because at the time of sailing ships they were good for trade .

Rain is common in low pressure regions due to rising air .


Air sinking in high pressure areas causes evaporation ; these regions are usually dry .

The polar jet stream is found high up in the atmosphere where the two cells come together .

Mammals initially filled the forests that covered many early Cenozoic lands .


Over time , the forests gave way to grasslands , which created more niches for mammals to fill .


As climate cooled during the ice ages , large mammals were able to stand the cold weather , so many interesting megafauna developed .


These included giant sloths , saber-toothed cats , wooly mammoths , giant condors , and many other animals that are now extinct -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- .

A hypothesis will not be fully accepted unless it is supported by the work of many scientists .


Although a study may take place in a single laboratory , a scientist must present her work to the community of scientists in her field .


Later , she will write a paper to be published in a scientific journal .


After she submits the paper , several scientists will review the paper - a process called peer review - to suggest further investigations or changes in interpretation to make the paper stronger .

The first is a good scientific question that can be answered by radiometrically dating rocks among other techniques .


The second can not be answered using data , so it is not a scientific question .


Scientists use the scientific method to answer questions .


The scientific method is a series of steps that help to investigate a question .


A scientist might ask a question , then do some background research and discover that the question needed to be asked a different way , or that a different question should be asked .

Now , lets ask a scientific question .


Remember that it must be testable .


We learned above that average global temperature has been rising since record keeping began in 1880 .


This leads us to a question : Question : Is the amount of carbon dioxide in Earths atmosphere changing ?


How has carbon dioxide in the atmosphere changed over those 50-plus years -LRB- see Figure 1.1 -RRB- ?


About how much has atmospheric CO2 risen between 1958 and 2011 in parts per million ?


So weve answered the question using data from research that has already been done .


If scientists had not been monitoring CO2 levels over the years , wed have had to start these measurements now .


Because this question can be answered with data , it is testable .


By under - standing the way temperature changes with altitude , we can learn a lot about how the atmosphere works .


Gas molecules are able to move freely , and if they are uncontained , as they are in the atmosphere , they can take up more or less space .

When gas molecules are warm , they take up more space .

Warmer , lighter air is more buoyant than the cooler air above it , so it rises .


The cooler air then sinks down , because it is denser than the air beneath it .


This is convection , which was described in the chapter Plate Tectonics .


The property that changes most strikingly with altitude is air temperature .


Unlike the change in pressure and density , which decrease with altitude , changes in air temperature are not regular .
Unlike the change in pressure , which decrease with altitude , changes in air temperature are not regular .
Unlike the change in density , which decrease with altitude , changes in air temperature are not regular .

A change in temperature with distance is called a temperature gradient .


The atmosphere is divided into layers based on how the temperature in that layer changes with altitude , the layers temperature gradient -LRB- Figure 1.2 -RRB- .


In some layers , temperature increases with altitude and in others it decreases .
In some layers , temperature increases with altitude .
in others it decreases .

The temperature gradient in each layer is determined by the heat source of the layer -LRB- See opening image -RRB- .


Remember that the chemical composi - tion of each layer is nearly the same except for the ozone layer that is found in the stratosphere .


As air in a thunderstorm rises , the surrounding air races in to fill the gap .


This forms a tornado , a funnel-shaped , whirling column of air extending downward from a cumulonimbus cloud .


A tornado lasts from a few seconds to several hours .


A tornado travels over the ground at about 45 km per hour -LRB- 28 miles per hour -RRB- and goes about 25 km -LRB- 16 miles -RRB- before losing energy and disappearing -LRB- Figure 1.2 -RRB- .

Although there is an average of 770 tornadoes annually , the number of tornadoes each year varies greatly -LRB- Figure 1.4 -RRB- .


In late April 2011 , severe thunderstorms pictured in the satellite image spawned the deadliest set of tornadoes in more than 25 years .


In addition to the meeting of cP and mT mentioned above , the jet stream was blowing strongly Tornado damage at Ringgold , Georgia in April 2011 .

In other words , a warm front marks the leading edge of moving warm air .

At a stationary front the air masses do not move -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- .

When a cold air mass takes the place of a warm air mass , there is a cold front -LRB- Figure 1.2 -RRB- .


Winds may continue to blow into the low pressure zone at the front .


The weather at a cold front varies with the season .


Spring and summer : the air is unstable so thunderstorms or tornadoes may form .

Cumulus clouds build at a warm front .


Imagine that you are on the ground in the wintertime under a cold winter air mass with a warm front approaching .


The transition from cold air to warm air takes place over a long distance , so the first signs of changing weather appear long before the front is actually over you .


High cirrus clouds mark the transition from one air mass to the other .


Warm air moves forward to take over the position of colder air .

Some knowledge in science gains the status of a theory .


Scientists use the term theory differently than it is used in everyday language .


This theory is supported by a huge amount of evidence .


The evidence ranges from DNA to fossils like the ones in Figure 1.3 .


Another sort of scientific knowledge is called a law .


A scientific law is a description of what always occurs under certain conditions in nature .


Examples of scientific laws in life science include Mendels laws of inheritance .


These laws describe how traits are passed from parents to their offspring .


You might say , I think my dad is late because he got stuck in traffic , but its just a theory .

They form the foundation of every life science field .


Both theories have been tested repeatedly .


Both are supported by a great deal of evidence .


According to the cell theory , all organisms are made up of one or more cells .


Cells come only from pre-existing cells .


New cells forms when existing cells divide .


Most cells are too small to see without a microscope .


If you were to look at a drop of your blood under a microscope , Figure 1.5 shows two types of cells you might see .


The theory of evolution by natural selection explains how populations of organisms can change over time .


As environments change , so must the traits of organisms if they are to survive in the new conditions .


Evolution by natural selection explains how this happens .


You can see examples of the incredible diversity of living animals in Figure 1.6 .


You can read more about the theory of evolution in the chapter Evolution .


Most scientific theories were developed by scientists doing basic scientific research .


Like other sciences , life science may be either basic or applied science .
Like other sciences , life science may be either basic science .
Like other sciences , life science may be either applied science .

The aim of basic science is to discover new knowledge .

You can also see yeast cells dividing .


Knowledge gained by this basic research on yeast cells has been applied to practical problems .


Scientists have developed drugs to treat cancer based on knowledge of the cell cycle .


Cancer is a disease in which cells divide out of control .


The new drugs interfere with the cell cycle of cancer cells , so the cells stop dividing .


This is an example of applied science .


The aim of applied science is to find solutions to practical problems .


Applied science generally rests on knowledge gained by basic science .


A life scientist would carry out a scientific investigation to try to answer this question .


A scientific investigation follows a general plan called the scientific method .


The scientific method is a series of logical steps for testing a possible answer to a question .


The steps are shown in the flow chart in Figure 1.8 .


The steps of the scientific method are described in greater detail below .


Note that these steps are meant as a guide , not a rigid sequence .


Testable means that if the hypothesis is false , its possible to find evidence showing that its false .


This step usually requires some research .


You have to find out what other investigators have already learned about the observations .


For example , has anyone already tried to answer the question ?


What other hypotheses have been proposed ?


Test the hypothesis .


Make predictions based on the hypothesis and then determine if they are correct .

This may involve carrying out an experiment .


An experiment is a controlled scientific test that often takes place in a lab .


It investigates the effects of one factor , called the independent variable , on another factor , called the dependent variable .


Experimental controls are other factors that might affect the dependent variable .


Controls are kept constant so they will not affect the results of the experiment .


Analyze the results of the test and draw a conclusion .
Analyze the results of the test .
draw a conclusion .

Do the results agree with the predictions ?


If so , they provide support for the hypothesis .


If not , they disprove the hypothesis .


Communicate results .


One way is by presenting a poster at a scientific conference , like the scientists in Figure are communicated , scientists should describe their hypothesis and how it was tested in addition to the results of the test .

One way is by presenting a poster at a scientific conference , like the scientists in Figure are communicated , scientists should describe how it was tested in addition to the results of the test .

This allows other scientists to repeat the investigation to see whether they get the same results .


This is called replication .


Replication is important because it adds weight to the findings .


The results are more likely to be reliable if they can be repeated .


Make observations .


Observations refer to anything detected with one or more senses .


The senses include sight , hearing , touch , smell , and taste .

Some athletes tend to build more muscle mass .


Others tend to develop greater endurance .


You ask , Is there a gene that might explain these differences ?


You learn about a gene named ACE that might affect how people respond to athletic training .


Based on all of your research , you develop a hypothesis .


You hypothesize that people with different versions -LRB- D or I -RRB- of the ACE gene will respond differently to the same athletic training program .

By the time the earliest plants evolved , animals were already the dominant living things in the water .


Plants were also limited to the upper layer of water .


So plants never became dominant aquatic organisms .


All that changed when plants moved from water to land .

Moving to the land was a huge step in plant evolution .


Until then , virtually all life had evolved in water .


Simply absorbing enough water to stay alive was a huge challenge .


Water was also needed for sexual reproduction , so sperm could swim to eggs .


Solar radiation put land organisms at high risk of mutations .


After they left the water , plants evolved adaptations that helped them withstand the harsh conditions on land .


One of the earliest and most important adaptations to evolve was vascular tissue .

Early land plants also evolved a dominant sporophyte generation .


With all these adaptations , its easy to see why vascular plants were very successful .


As vascular plants spread , many nonvascular plants went extinct .


Vascular plants became and remain the dominant land plants on Earth .

Early vascular plants still needed moisture .


They needed it in order to reproduce .


Sperm had to swim from male to female reproductive organs for fertilization .


Even spores needed some water to grow and often to disperse as well .

Even spores needed some water often to disperse as well .

In addition , dryness and other harsh conditions made it very difficult for tiny new offspring plants to survive .


With the evolution of seeds in vascular plants , all that changed .


Seed plants evolved a number of adaptations that made it possible to reproduce without water .


Seeds also nourished and protected tiny new offspring .

These included pollen .
These included pollen tubes .

Pollen also evolved the ability to grow a tube , called a pollen tube .


Sperm could be transferred through the tube directly from the pollen grain to the egg .


This allowed sperm to reach an egg without swimming through a film of water .


It finally freed plants from depending on moisture to reproduce .


The gametophyte produces an egg cell .


After the egg is fertilized by sperm , the ovule develops into a seed .


Pollen is a tiny male gametophyte enclosed in a tough capsule .


Pollen carries sperm to an ovule while preventing the sperm from drying out .


Pollen grains cant swim , but they are very light , so the wind can carry them .

The first seed plants formed seeds in cones , like the cone in Figure 10.16 .


Cones are reproductive structures made of overlapping scales .


Scales are modified leaves .


Male cones contain pollen .


Female cones contain eggs .


They are also where seeds develop .


Some seed plants evolved another major adaptation .

Modern nonvascular plants are called bryophytes .


They also need water to reproduce .


Bryophytes live in moist habitats .

All living plants today have land-plant ancestors .


For example , the cattails shown in Figure 10.26 have narrow , strap-like leaves that reduce their resistance to moving water .


But some plants now live in the water .


Modern plants that live in water are called aquatic plants .

Plants that are adapted to very dry environments are called xerophytes .


The saguaro cactus pictured in Figure 10.27 has adapted in all three ways .


When it was still a very small plant , just a few inches high , its shallow roots already reached out as much as 2 meters -LRB- 7 feet -RRB- from the base of the stem .


It allows the cactus to gather as much moisture as possible from rare rainfalls .


The saguaro doesnt have any leaves to lose water by transpiration .


It also has a large , barrel-shaped stem that can store a lot of water .


Thorns protect the stem from thirsty animals that might try to get at the water inside .


Plants called epiphytes grow on other plants .


They obtain moisture from the air instead of the soil .


Most epiphytes are ferns or orchids that live in rainforests .

A general animal life cycle is shown in Figure 11.3 .


For example , a caterpillar is the larval form of an insect that becomes a butterfly as an adult .


Most animals spend the majority of their life as diploid organisms .


Just about all animals reproduce sexually .

The embryo eventually develops into an adult , often going through one or more larval stages on the way .


A larva -LRB- larvae , plural -RRB- is a distinct juvenile form that many animals go through before becoming an adult .


The Animal Kingdom , in turn , is divided into almost 40 phyla .


All of them are placed in the Phylum Chordata .


Modern vertebrates include fish , amphibians , reptiles , birds , and mammals .
Modern vertebrates include fish .
Modern vertebrates include amphibians .
Modern vertebrates include reptiles .

Modern vertebrates include mammals .

Table 11.1 lists the 9 animal phyla that contain the largest numbers of species .


Phylum Porifera Animals It Includes sponges Cnidaria jellyfish , corals Platyhelminthes flatworms , tapeworms , flukes Nematoda roundworms Mollusca snails , clams , squids Phylum Annelida Animals It Includes earthworms , leeches , marine worms Arthropoda insects , spiders , crustaceans , cen - tipedes Echinodermata sea stars , sea urchins , sand dollars , sea cucumbers Chordata tunicates , lancelets , fish , amphib - ians , reptiles , birds , mammals One basic way to divide animals is between invertebrates and vertebrates .


All the phyla in Table 11.1 , except the Phylum Chordata , consist only of invertebrates .


Even the Phylum Chordata includes some invertebrate taxa .


Invertebrates make up about 95 percent of all animal species .


The oldest animal fossils are about 630 million years old , so presumably animals evolved around that time or somewhat earlier .
The oldest animal fossils are about 630 million years old , so presumably animals evolved around that time .
The oldest animal fossils are about 630 million years old , so presumably animals evolved somewhat earlier .

The first vertebrates evolved around 550 million years ago .


By 500 million years ago , most modern phyla of animals had evolved .


The first terrestrial animals evolved about 50 million years after that .


Animals evolved many important traits that set them apart from other eukaryotes .


Each of these traits is described below .


All of them evolved in invertebrates .


Each major trait to evolve led to a new stage in animal evolution .


The phyla in Table 11.1 represent modern animals at each of these major stages .


Refer back to the table as you read about the evolution of these traits .


The first animal trait to evolve was multicellularity .


They are placed in Phylum Porifera -LRB- see Table 11.1 -RRB- .


They have multiple specialized cells , but their cells are not organized into tissues .
They have multiple specialized cells .
their cells are not organized into tissues .

Scientists think that the earliest animals with multiple cells evolved from animal-like protists that lived in colonies .


Some of the cells in the colonies became specialized for different jobs .


After a while , the specialized cells came to need each other for survival .


Thus , the first multicellular animals evolved .


They could evolve special adaptations that allowed them to do a particular job really well .


Modern animals that represent this stage of animal evolution are sponges .


At first , invertebrates developed tissues from just two embryonic cell layers .


There was an outer cell layer called ectoderm and an inner cell layer called endoderm .
There was an outer cell layer called ectoderm .
There was an inner cell layer called endoderm .

The two cell layers allowed different types of tissues to form .


Modern animals that represent this stage of evolution include jellyfish .


Another trait that evolved early was symmetry .


A symmetrical organism can be divided into two identical halves .


Bilateral symmetry could come about only after animals evolved a distinctive head region where nerve tissue was concentrated .


Animals with bilateral symmetry can tell left from right .
Animals with bilateral symmetry can tell left .
Animals with bilateral symmetry can tell right .

Both the coral and the beetle in Figure 11.6 have symmetry , while the sponge lacks symmetry .
Both the coral in Figure 11.6 have symmetry , while the sponge lacks symmetry .
Both the beetle in Figure 11.6 have symmetry , while the sponge lacks symmetry .

Radial symmetry is demonstrated by the coral in Figure 11.6 .


Radial symmetry was the first type of symmetry to evolve .


This makes controlled movement in these directions impossible .


Bilateral symmetry is demonstrated by the beetle in Figure 11.6 .


The next major trait to evolve was mesoderm .


Modern animals that represent this stage of evolution are the flatworms .


Evolution of this new cell layer allowed animals to develop new types of tissues , such as muscle tissue .


This led to the evolution of digestive organs .


Modern animals that represent this stage of evolution are roundworms .


They are placed in Phylum Nematoda .


There was just one opening for food to enter the body and waste to leave the body .
There was just one opening for food to enter the body .
There was just one opening for waste to leave the body .

A modern jellyfish has this type of digestive system , as shown in Figure 11.8 .


Eventually a complete digestive system with two body openings evolved , as shown in Figure 11.8 .


With a separate mouth and anus , food could move through the body in just one direction .
With a separate mouth , food could move through the body in just one direction .
With a separate anus , food could move through the body in just one direction .

This made digestion more efficient .


An animal could keep eating while digesting food and getting rid of waste .

An animal could keep eating while getting rid of waste .

Different parts of the digestive tract could also become specialized for different digestive functions .


The next major animal trait to evolve was a body cavity filled with fluid .


At first , this was just a partial body cavity , called a pseudocoelom .


Later , a true coelom evolved .


This is a fluid-filled body cavity that is completely enclosed by mesoderm .


The coelom lies between the digestive cavity and body wall .


Modern invertebrates with a coelom include mollusks -LRB- Phylum Mollusca -RRB- and annelids -LRB- Phylum Annelida -RRB- .
Modern invertebrates with a coelom include mollusks -LRB- Phylum Mollusca -RRB- .
Modern invertebrates with a coelom include annelids -LRB- Phylum Annelida -RRB- .

A pseudocoelom isnt completely enclosed by mesoderm .


However , it still allows room for internal organs to develop .


The fluid in the cavity also cushions the internal organs .


The pressure of the fluid provides stiffness as well .


Modern invertebrates with a pseudocoelom include roundworms .


Flatworms lack this trait .


This difference explains why roundworms are round whereas flatworms are flat .


Segmentation evolved next .


For example , they evolved jointed legs for walking and jointed feelers -LRB- antennae -RRB- for sensing .

Notice the ants jointed legs and antennae in Figure 11.11 .

Segmentation increases an animals flexibility .


Different segments can also be specialized for different functions .


Arthropods also evolved jointed appendages .


Some invertebrates evolved a rigid rod along the length of their body .


This rod is called a notochord .


The notochord gives the body support and shape .
The notochord gives the body support .
The notochord gives the body shape .

It also provides a place for muscles to attach .


Animals with a notochord are called chordates .


All of them are placed in Phylum Chordata .


Some early chordates eventually evolved into vertebrates .


The earliest vertebrates evolved around 550 million years ago .


It happened when some chordates evolved a backbone to replace the notochord after the embryo stage .

The earliest vertebrates probably looked like the hagfish in Figure 11.13 .


Invertebrates were the first animals to colonize the land .


The move to land occurred about 450 million years ago .


For example , animals needed a way to keep their body from drying out .


They also needed a way to support their body on dry land without the buoyancy of water .


One way early land invertebrates solved these problems was with an exoskeleton .


This is a non-bony skeleton that forms on the outside of the body .


It supports the body and helps it retain water .
It supports the body .

In addition , they have special organs for breathing and excreting wastes .


In some arthropods , the head and thorax are joined together .
In some arthropods , the head are joined together .
In some arthropods , the thorax are joined together .

The exoskeleton -LRB- or external skeleton -RRB- of an arthropod consists of several layers of cuticle .


The exoskeleton prevents water loss .


The exoskeleton doesnt grow larger as the animal grows .


This happens periodically throughout an arthropods life .


The shedding of the exoskeleton is called molting .


Because arthropod appendages are jointed , they can bend .


This makes them flexible .

Arthropods reproduce sexually .


Male and female adults produce gametes .
Male adults produce gametes .
female adults produce gametes .

They allow functions to be divided among different life stages .


Each life stage can evolve adaptations to suit it for its specific functions without affecting the adaptations of the other stages .


In some arthropods , newly hatched offspring look like small adults .


These arthropods dont go through larval stages .


They just grow larger until they reach adult size .


This type of life cycle is called incomplete metamorphosis .


If fertilization occurs , eggs hatch into offspring .


After hatching , most arthropods go through one or more larval stages before reaching adulthood .


The larvae may look very different from the adults .


They change into the adult form in a process called metamorphosis .

In fact , more than half of all known organisms are insects .


There may be more than 10 million insect species in the world , although most of them have not yet been identified .


The abdomen contains most of the internal organs .


Insects have also evolved a wide range of specialized mouthparts for eating certain foods .


Six legs are attached to the thorax .


Insects use their antennae to smell and taste chemicals .

The notochord is a rigid rod that runs down the back of the body .


It includes at least 60,000 species , including the human species .


For a visual introduction to chordates , watch this video : http : //video.about.com/animals/What-Is-Phylum-Chordata-.htm


There are four traits that are unique to chordates and define Phylum Chordata .

Tunicates are invertebrate chordates that lose some of the four defining chordate traits by adulthood .


Tunicates are also called sea squirts .


However , fertilization always involves gametes from different parents .


Asexual reproduction is by budding .

The skin is kept moist by mucus , which is secreted by mucous glands .


In some species , the mucous glands also secrete toxins that make the animal poisonous to predators .


The toxin in their mucus is used by native people in South America to poison the tips of their hunting arrows .


Amphibian skin contains keratin , a protein that is also found in the outer covering of most other four-legged vertebrates .


The keratin in amphibians is not too tough to allow gases and water to pass through their skin .

The eggs are usually covered with a jelly-like substance that offers some projection from predators .

Amphibians generally lay large numbers of eggs .


Often , many adults lay eggs in the same place at the same time .


This helps ensure that the eggs will be fertilized .


Once eggs are laid , amphibian parents typically provide no parental care .


Most amphibians go through a larval stage that is different from the adult form .


In frogs , for example , the early larval stage resembles a fish , as you can see in Figure 13.14 .


Frogs at this stage of development are called tadpoles .


Tadpoles live in the water .


They also have gills , which absorb oxygen from the water .


All of these changes prepare it to live on the land .


In Figure 13.15 , you can see how a frog larva looks as it changes to the adult form .

Reptiles were the first vertebrates to lay amniotic eggs .


For example , their chest muscles contract to push air out of the lungs .


The muscles relax to allow air to rush into the lungs .

Nonetheless , they share several traits that set them apart from other vertebrates .


Two traits are used to define the mammal class .


Mammary glands are glands that produce milk after the birth of offspring .


Producing milk for offspring is called lactation .


The colt in Figure 14.9 is getting milk from its mother .


Most mammals share several other traits .


These include : a large , complex brain and relatively great intelligence ; ears with specialized structures that make them extremely good at hearing ; four different types of teeth -LRB- reptiles have just one type -RRB- , allowing them to eat a wide range of foods ; tiny air sacs called alveoli -LRB- alveolus , singular -RRB- in the lungs for enhanced gas exchange ; and glands in the skin that produce sweat , a salty fluid that helps cool down the body .

Mammals are noted for the many ways they can move .


Some mammals are well known for their speed .


The limbs of most mammals are specialized for a particular way of moving .


The limbs of some mammals are even specialized for swinging through tree tops .


Mammals have a variety of ways to keep their body temperature stable .


Mammals stay warm in cool weather in two general ways .


One way is by generating more heat .


Like the squirrel in Figure 14.11 , most mammals can make their hair or fur stand up from the skin .
Like the squirrel in Figure 14.11 , most mammals can make their hair stand up from the skin .
Like the squirrel in Figure 14.11 , most mammals can make their fur stand up from the skin .

This makes it a better insulator .


Mammals also have a layer of insulating fat beneath their skin .


Other vertebrates lack this layer of fat .


The other way is by conserving the heat that is generated .


Mammals generate heat mainly by maintaining a high rate of metabolism .


Compared with the cells of other animals , the cells of mammals have more mitochondria .


Mitochondria are the cell organelles that generate energy .


Mammals may also produce little bursts of heat by shivering .


Shivering occurs when many muscles all contract slightly at the same time .


The muscle contractions generate a small amount of heat .


Mammals conserve heat with their hair or fur .
Mammals conserve heat with their hair .
Mammals conserve heat with their fur .

In hot weather , mammals may need to lose excess body heat .


One way they do this is by increasing blood flow to the body surface .


The increased blood flow warms the skin , which gives off heat to the environment .


Most mammals also sweat to lose excess heat .


Evaporation of the sweat requires heat .


The heat comes from the body and cools it down .
The heat comes from the body .
The heat cools it down .

Animals with fur , like the dogs in Figure 14.12 , may pant instead of sweat to lose body heat .


Water evaporates from the tongue and other moist surfaces of the mouth , using heat from the body .

Generating body heat to stay warm takes a lot of energy .


Mammals are heterotrophs that get their energy by eating other organisms .


Mammals eat a wide range of different foods .

Placental mammals get their name from the placenta .


This is a spongy structure that develops during pregnancy only in placental mammals .


This increases its chances of survival .


On the other hand , supporting a growing fetus may be difficult for the mother .


She has to eat more while pregnant and may become less mobile as the fetus grows larger .

In addition to human beings , this order consists of lemurs , tarsiers , monkeys , and apes .


It includes mammals that range in size from the tiny mouse lemur , which weighs only 30 g -LRB- about an ounce -RRB- , to the majestic gorilla , an ape that may weigh as much as 200 kg -LRB- 440 lb -RRB- .

Primates have widely spaced eyes in the same plane that give them stereoscopic -LRB- 3-D -RRB- vision , needed for judging distances .


Some primates , including humans , have also evolved color vision .


Primates tend to have bigger brains for their body size than other mammals .


This is reflected in their relatively high level of intelligence and their ability to learn new behaviors .

Why do animals behave in the ways pictured in Figure 15.1 ?


The specific answer depends on what the behavior is .


If genes control behaviors that increase fitness , the behaviors become more common in the species .


Male flamingoes put on a noisy group show in order to attract females for mating .


Frogs call out to attract mates or to warn other frogs to stay away from their territory .

All of these behaviors have the purpose of promoting survival .

Like the animals pictured above , all animals have behaviors that help them achieve these basic ends .


Behaviors that help animals reproduce or survive increase their fitness .
Behaviors that help animals reproduce increase their fitness .
Behaviors that help animals survive increase their fitness .

Animals with greater fitness have a better chance of passing their genes to the next generation .


All of the animal behaviors pictured in Figure 15.1 are ways that animals act without being taught to act in these ways .


Such behaviors are called innate .


An innate behavior is any behavior that occurs naturally in all the animals of a given species .


An innate behavior is also called an instinct .


The first time an animal performs an innate behavior , the animal does it well .


The animal doesnt have to practice the behavior in order to get it right or to become better at doing it .
The animal doesnt have to practice the behavior in order to get it right .
The animal doesnt have to practice the behavior to become better at doing it .

All members of a species perform an innate behavior in the same way .


Even behaviors that seem complex and difficult may be innate .
Even behaviors that seem complex may be innate .
Even behaviors that seem difficult may be innate .

For example , honeybees perform dances in order to communicate about food sources .


When a honeybee , like the one in Figure 15.2 , finds a food source , it returns to its hive and does a dance , called the waggle dance .
When a honeybee , like the one in Figure 15.2 , finds a food source , it returns to its hive .
When a honeybee , like the one in Figure 15.2 , finds a food source , it does a dance , called the waggle dance .

The way the bee moves during its dance tells other bees in the hive where to find the food .


Honeybees can do the waggle dance without learning it from other bees , so it is an innate behavior .

Innate behaviors occur in all animals .


A reflex behavior is a simple response that always occurs when a certain stimulus is present .


Human reflex behaviors occur mainly in babies .


You may have seen a baby exhibit the grasp reflex shown in Figure this way from birth to about 6 months of age .


Its easy to see why this might help a baby survive .


Grabbing onto something could keep a baby from falling and being injured .

Did you ever teach a dog to sit on command ?


Thats an example of a learned behavior .


The dog wasnt born knowing that it should sit when it hears the word sit .


The dog had to learn the behavior .


Most animals are capable of learning , but animals that are more intelligent are better at learning and depend more on learned behaviors .
Most animals are capable of learning .
animals that are more intelligent are better at learning .
animals that are more intelligent depend more on learned behaviors .

The big advantage of learned behaviors over innate behaviors is that learned behaviors are flexible .


They can be changed to suit changing conditions .


Human beings depend on learned behaviors more than any other species .


One of the simplest ways of learning that occurs in just about all animals is habituation .


Habituation means learning to get used to something after being exposed to it repeatedly .


It usually involves getting used to something that is frightening or annoying but not dangerous .
It usually involves getting used to something that is frightening .
It usually involves getting used to something that is annoying .
It usually involves getting used to something that is dangerous .

Look at the crows in Figure 15.5 .

Human children learn many behaviors this way .


Other animals also learn through observational learning .

Conditioning is a way of learning that involves a reward or punishment .
Conditioning is a way of learning that involves a reward .
Conditioning is a way of learning that involves a punishment .

If you ever trained a dog to obey a command , you probably gave the dog a tasty treat each time he performed the desired behavior .


In this case , the behavior is learned because it is rewarded with nectar .


Many birds learn to avoid eating monarch butterflies , like the one pictured in Figure 15.7 .


Monarch butterflies taste bad and make birds sick .
Monarch butterflies taste bad .
Monarch butterflies make birds sick .

In this case , the behavior is learned because it is punished with a nasty taste and illness .
In this case , the behavior is learned because it is punished with a nasty taste .
In this case , the behavior is learned because it is punished with illness .

It may not have been very long before the dog would reliably follow the command in order to get the treat .


This is an example of conditioning that involves a reward .


Conditioning does not always involve a reward .


For example , a dog might be scolded each time she jumps up on the sofa .


After repeated scolding , she may learn to stay off the sofa .


Conditioning occurs in nature as well .


Here are just two examples : Bees learn to find nectar in certain types of flowers because they have found nectar in those types of flowers before .


Many animals , especially mammals , spend a lot of time playing when they are young .


Although playing is fun , its likely that animals play for other reasons as well .


For example , playing games and sports may help them learn how to follow rules and work with others .

Insight learning is learning from past experiences and reasoning .
Insight learning is learning from past experiences .
Insight learning is learning from past reasoning .

It generally involves coming up with new ways to solve problems .


One type of insight learning is making tools to solve problems .


Scientists used to think that humans were the only animals intelligent enough to make tools .


In recent decades , however , there have been many observations of other animal species using tools .


You can see a monkey using a stone tool in Figure 15.9 .


Chimpanzees have been observed using sticks to fish for termites in a termite mound .


Crows have been seen bending wire to form a hook in order to pull food out of a tube .


Behaviors such as these show that other species of animals besides humans can use their experience and reasoning to solve problems .
Behaviors such as these show that other species of animals besides humans can use their experience to solve problems .

Insight learning generally happens quickly .


Insight learning requires relatively great intelligence .


Human beings use insight learning more than any other species .


They have used it to invent the wheel to land astronauts on the moon .


You may have figured out how to solve a new type of math problem or how to get to the next level of a video game .

Communication is any way that animals share information .


Many animals live in social groups .


For these animals , being able to communicate is essential .


Communicating increases the ability of group members to cooperate and avoid conflict .

Different animal species use a range of senses for communicating .


Bees communicate with a waggle dance .


They use it to tell other bees where food is located .


A wide range of animals communicate by releasing chemicals they can smell or detect in some other way .

You might answer a question by shrugging your shoulders , which means I dont know .


You might use a thumbs-up gesture when a friend scores a goal to mean Good job .


The most important way that humans communicate is with language .


Words may stand for things , people , actions , feelings , or ideas .
Words may stand for things .
Words may stand for people .
Words may stand for actions .
Words may stand for feelings .
Words may stand for ideas .

By combining words in sentences , language can be used to express very complex thoughts .


Another important way that humans communicate is with facial expressions .


Look at the facial expressions of the girl in Figure 15.13 .


Without communication , animals would not be able to live together in groups .


Animals that live in groups with other members of their species are called social animals .


Social animals include many species of insects , birds , and mammals .
Social animals include many species of insects .
Social animals include many species of birds .
Social animals include many species of mammals .

In these species , members of the group depend completely on one another .


Each worker has a specific task to perform , depending on its age .


Young worker bees clean the hive and feed the offspring .

Older worker bees build the waxy honeycomb or guard the hive .
Older worker bees build the waxy honeycomb .
Older worker bees guard the hive .

The oldest worker bees leave the hive to find food .


Their only job is to mate with the queen .


Therefore , group members must work together for the good of all .


Look at the honeybees in Figure 15.14 .


Honeybees live in colonies that may consist of thousands of individual bees .


Bees and other social animals must cooperate to live together successfully .
Bees must cooperate to live together successfully .
other social animals must cooperate to live together successfully .

Cooperation means working together with others .


Members of the group may cooperate by dividing up tasks , defending each other , and sharing food .
Members of the group may cooperate by dividing up tasks .
Members of the group may cooperate by defending each other .
Members of the group may cooperate by sharing food .

The ants in Figure 15.15 are sharing food .


One ant is transferring food directly from its mouth to the mouth of another colony member .


For example , in meerkat colonies , young female meerkats act as babysitters .


They take care of the baby meerkats while their parents are out looking for food .


Some of the most important behaviors in animals involve reproduction .


They include behaviors to attract mates and behaviors for taking care of the young .
They include behaviors to attract mates .
They include behaviors for taking care of the young .

In many animal species , females choose the males they will mate with .


Female grouse watch the dance and then mate with the males that put on the best display .
Female grouse watch the dance .
Female grouse mate with the males that put on the best display .

You can see a group of male grouse performing their courtship dance in this short video : .


For their part , males try to show females that they would be better mates than other males .


To be chosen as mates , males may perform courtship behaviors .


These are special behaviors that help attract a mate .


Male courtship behaviors are meant to get the attention of females and show off a males traits .
Male courtship behaviors are meant to get the attention of females .
Male courtship behaviors are meant to show off a males traits .

An example of courtship behavior in birds is shown in Figure 15.16 .


Each year in the spring , as many as two dozen grouse males gather in a grassy area to perform their courtship dance .


This may include building a nest or other shelter .
This may include building a nest .
This may include building other shelter .

If the chick hatches before the mother returns , the father feeds it with a high-protein , high-fat substance he produces just for this purpose .


You can see an emperor penguin father feeding his chick in Figure 15.17 .


It may also include feeding the young and protecting them from predators .
It may also include feeding the young .
It may also include protecting them from predators .

This , in turn , increases the parents fitness , so such behaviors evolve by natural selection .


Emperor penguins make great sacrifices to take care of their young .


After laying an egg , a penguin mother returns to the sea for two months to feed .


Her mate stays behind to keep the egg warm .


He balances the egg on top of his feet to keep it warm for the entire time the mother is away .


This means that they defend an area that typically includes their nest and enough food for themselves and their offspring .
This means that they defend an area that typically includes their nest .
This means that they defend an area that typically includes enough food for themselves .
This means that they defend an area that typically includes enough food for their offspring .

Animals generally dont fight to defend their territory .

Examples of animals that hibernate include some species of insects -LRB- see Figure 15.18 -RRB- .

They are triggered by changes in the environment , such as the days growing shorter in the fall .


Migrating animals generally follow the same route each year .


Many animals go through daily cycles .


Daily cycles of behavior are called circadian rhythms .


The biological clock sends signals to the body .


The signals cause regular changes in behavior and body processes .
The signals cause regular changes in behavior .
The signals cause regular changes in body processes .

The biological clock , in turn , is controlled by changes in the amount of light entering the eyes .


Thats why the biological clock causes changes that repeat every 24 hours .


For example , most animals go to sleep when the sun sets down and wake up when the sun rises .
For example , most animals go to sleep when the sun sets down .

In the U.S. , packaged foods must be labeled with nutritional information .


A nutrition facts label shows the main nutrients in one serving of the food .


Packaged foods must also be labeled with their ingredients .


An ingredient is a specific item that a food contains .


Look at the nutrition facts label in Figure 17.7 .


Instructions at the right of the label tell you what to look for .

At the top of the label , look for the serving size .


The serving size tells you how much of the food you should eat to get the nutrients listed on the label .


For this food , 1 cup is a serving .


The Calories in one serving are listed next .


In this food , there are 250 Calories per serving .


Next on the nutrition facts label , look for the percent daily values -LRB- % DV -RRB- of several nutrients .


The percent daily value shows what percent of daily needs for a given nutrient that the food provides -LRB- based on a 2000 - Calorie-per-day diet -RRB- .


The food label in Figure 17.8 represents a different food and includes the list of ingredients .
The food label in Figure 17.8 represents a different food .
The food label in Figure 17.8 includes the list of ingredients .

The main ingredient is always listed first .


You should also use moderation when eating foods that contain ingredients such as white flour or white rice .

Ingredients such as these are needed in the greatest amounts for balanced eating .


Avoid foods that list fats , oils , sugar , or salt near the top of the list .
Avoid foods that list fats near the top of the list .
Avoid foods that list oils near the top of the list .
Avoid foods that list sugar near the top of the list .
Avoid foods that list salt near the top of the list .

For good health , you should avoid getting too much of these ingredients .


You should try to get at least an hour of exercise just about every day -LRB- see Figure 17.9 -RRB- .


Exercise has many health benefits in addition to balancing the energy in food .


What happens if you dont get enough exercise to balance the food you eat ?


Any unused energy in the food is stored as fat .


If you take in more energy than you use day after day , you will store more and more fat and become overweight .
If you take in more energy than you use day after day , you will store more and more fat .
If you take in more energy than you use day after day , you will become overweight .

Eventually , you may become obese .

To balance energy with exercise , aim to get about an hour of physical activity each day .


Predation is a relationship in which members of one species consume members of another species .


The consuming species is called the predator .


The species that is consumed is called the prey .


A predator-prey relationship tends to keep the populations of both species in balance .


Look at the graph in Figure population also increases .


As the number of predators increases , more prey are captured .


This causes the prey population to decrease , followed by the predator population decreasing again .


Some predator species play a special role in their community .


When the population size of a keystone species changes , the populations of many other species are affected .


Prairie dogs , pictured in Figure 23.10 , are an example of a keystone species .


Their numbers affect most of the other species in their community .


Both predators and prey have adaptations to predation that evolve through natural selection .

Competition is a relationship between organisms that depend on the same resources .


Competition can occur between organisms of the same species or between organisms of different species .
Competition can occur between organisms of the same species .
Competition can occur between organisms of different species .

It leads to natural selection within the species , so the species becomes better adapted to its environment .


Competition between different species is called interspecific competition .


It might lead to the less well-adapted species going extinct .


Or it might lead to one or both species evolving specialized adaptations .
Or it might lead to one species evolving specialized adaptations .
Or it might lead to both species evolving specialized adaptations .

For example , competing species might evolve adaptations that allow them to use different food sources .


An example of mutualism is pictured in Figure can inject poison in the anemones prey .


The clownfish is protected from the stingers by mucus that covers its body .


How do the two species benefit from their close relationship ?


The anemone provides the clownfish with a safe place to live by keeping away predatory fish .


The clownfish also feeds on the remains of the anemones prey .


In return , the clownfish helps the anemone catch food by attracting prey with its bright colors .


Its feces also provide nutrients to the anemone .


Parasitism is a symbiotic relationship in which one species benefits and the other species is harmed .
Parasitism is a symbiotic relationship in which one species benefits .
Parasitism is a symbiotic relationship in which the other species is harmed .

The species that benefits is called the parasite .


If a parasite kills its host , the parasite may also die .


Instead , parasites usually cause relatively minor damage to their host .


The species that is harmed is called the host .


A parasite generally lives in or on its host .
A parasite generally lives in its host .
A parasite generally lives on its host .

An example of a parasite that lives in its host is the hookworm .


Figure from their host , which is harmed by the loss of nutrients and blood .

Some parasites kill their host , but most do not .
Some parasites kill their host .
most do not .

Its easy to see why .


Commensalism is a symbiotic relationship in which one species benefits while the other species is not affected .


An example is the relationship between birds called cattle egrets and cattle -LRB- see Figure 23.15 -RRB- .


Cattle egrets feed on insects .


They follow cattle herds around to take advantage of the insects stirred up by the feet of the cattle .


The egrets get ready access to food from the relationship , whereas the cattle are not affected .


Ecosystems need a constant input of energy to supply the needs of their organisms .


Most ecosystems get energy from sunlight .


A few ecosystems get energy from chemical compounds .


Unlike energy , matter doesnt need to be constantly added to ecosystems .


Instead , matter is recycled through ecosystems .


Water and elements such as carbon and nitrogen that living things need are used over and over again .

Features of a habitat depend mainly on abiotic factors , such as rainfall .

These factors influence the traits of the organisms that live there .


A given habitat may contain many different species .


Two different species can not occupy the same niche in the same habitat at the same time .


This is called the competitive exclusion principle .


What do you think would happen if two species were to occupy the same niche in the same habitat ?


The two species would compete for everything they needed in the environment .


One species might outcompete and replace the other .
One species might outcompete the other .
One species might replace the other .

Or , both species might evolve different specializations so they can fill slightly different niches .


Living things can be classified based on how they obtain energy .


Some use the energy in sunlight or chemical compounds directly to make food .

A food chain is a diagram that represents a single pathway through which energy flows through an ecosystem .


Food chains are generally simpler than what really happens in nature .


Thats because most organisms consume and are consumed by more than one species .

A food web is a diagram that represents many pathways through which energy flows through an ecosystem .


It includes a number of intersecting food chains .


Food webs are generally more similar to what really happens in nature .


They show that most organisms consume and are consumed by multiple species .

The trophic levels are identified in the food web in Figure 24.5 .


Trophic level 1 = producers that make their own food Trophic level 2 = primary consumers that eat producers Trophic level 3 = secondary consumers that eat primary consumers Trophic level 4 = tertiary consumers that eat secondary consumers Many consumers feed at more than one trophic level .


For example , the bivalves in Figure 24.5 eat both producers and primary consumers .
For example , the bivalves in Figure 24.5 eat both producers .

Energy is passed up a food chain or web from lower to higher trophic levels .
Energy is passed up a food chain from lower to higher trophic levels .
Energy is passed up a web from lower to higher trophic levels .

However , only about 10 percent of the energy at one level is passed up the next level .


This is represented by the ecological pyramid in Figure 24.6 .


The other 90 percent of energy at each trophic level is used for metabolic processes or given off to the environment as heat .
The other 90 percent of energy at each trophic level is used for metabolic processes .

This loss of energy explains why there are rarely more than four trophic levels in a food chain or web .
This loss of energy explains why there are rarely more than four trophic levels in a food chain .
This loss of energy explains why there are rarely more than four trophic levels in a web .

There isnt enough energy left to support additional levels .


It also explains why ecosystems need a constant input of energy .


This is also represented in the pyramid in Figure 24.6 .


Organisms tend to be larger in size at higher trophic levels .


However , their smaller numbers result in less biomass .


Primary succession occurs in an area that has never before been colonized by living things .


Secondary succession occurs in a formerly inhabited area that was disturbed .


This type of environment could come about when : a landslide uncovers bare rock a glacier retreats and leaves behind bare rock lava flows from a volcano and hardens into bare rock -LRB- see Figure 24.12 -RRB- Secondary succession could result from a fire , flood , or human action such as farming .

Does a changing ecosystem ever stop changing ?


Does its community of organisms ever reach some final , stable state ?


Scientists used to think that ecological succession always ended at a stable state , called a climax community .


Now their thinking has changed .


Most ecosystems are disturbed too often to ever develop a climax community .

No one knows for sure because only a small percentage of them have already been discovered .

Extinction is the complete dying out of a species .


Once a species goes extinct , it can never return .


More than 99 percent of all the species that ever lived on Earth have gone extinct .


Five mass extinctions have occurred in Earths history .


The fifth mass extinction wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago .


Evidence shows that a sixth mass extinction is happening right now .


Species are currently going extinct at the fastest rate since the dinosaurs died out .


Dozens of species are going extinct every day .


If this rate continues , as many as half of all remaining species could go extinct by 2050 .

Mendel was an Austrian Monk who lived in the 1800s .


Then he observed what traits showed up in their offspring .


Pea plants were a good choice to study for several reasons .


The male gametes are released by tiny grains of pollen .


The female gametes lie deep within the flowers .


Fertilization occurs when pollen from one flower reaches the female gametes in the same or a different flower .
Fertilization occurs when pollen from one flower reaches the female gametes in the same flower .
Fertilization occurs when pollen from one flower reaches the female gametes in a different flower .

This is called pollination .


Mendel was able to control which plants pollinated each other .


In addition , peas have many traits that are easy to observe , and each trait exists in two different forms .


Figure 6.2 shows the traits that Mendel studied in pea plants .


Pea plants reproduce sexually .


At first , Mendel studied one trait at a time .


These experiments led to his first law , the law of segregation .


Then Mendel studied two traits at a time .


These experiments led to his second law , the law of independent assortment .


Mendel let the FI plants pollinate themselves .


This is called self-pollination .


These offspring formed the second generation -LRB- F2 -RRB- .


Surprisingly , the trait of white flowers showed up in the F2 plants .


Mendel repeated this experiment with each of the other traits .


This is called cross-pollination .


One form of the trait seemed to disappear in the F1 plants .


Then it showed up again in the F2 plants .


Moreover , the two forms of the trait always showed up in the F2 plants in the same 3:1 ratio .


Then Mendel observed flower color in their offspring .


The offspring formed the first generation -LRB- F1 -RRB- .


Mendel wondered , `` What happened to the white form of the trait ? ``


Based on these results , Mendel concluded that each trait is controlled by two factors .


He also concluded that one of the factors for each trait dominates the other .


It explains why both forms of the trait show up again in the F2 plants .


One out of four F2 plants inherits two of the recessive factors for the trait .


In these plants , the recessive form of the trait is expressed .


He used the term recessive to describe the other factor .


If both factors are present in an individual , only the dominant factor is expressed .


This explains why one form of a trait always seems to disappear in the F1 plants .


These plants inherit both factors for the trait , but only the dominant factor shows up .
These plants inherit both factors for the trait .
only the dominant factor shows up .

The recessive factor is hidden .


When F1 plants reproduce , the two factors separate and go to different gametes .
When F1 plants reproduce , the two factors separate .
When F1 plants reproduce , the two factors go to different gametes .

Mendel wondered whether different traits are inherited together .


For example , are seed form and seed color passed together from parents to offspring ?
For example , are seed form passed together from parents to offspring ?
For example , are seed color passed together from parents to offspring ?

For example there were plants that had round , green seeds , as well as plants that had wrinkled , yellow seeds .


The ratios are shown across the bottom of Figure 6.5 .


Mendel repeated this experiment with other combinations of two traits .


One form of each trait seemed to disappear in the F1 plants .


Then these forms reappeared in the F2 plants in all possible combinations .


Moreover , the different combinations of traits always occurred in the same 9:3:3:1 ratio .


Or do the two traits split up in the offspring ?


To answer these questions , Mendel studied two traits at a time .


For example , he crossed plants that had round , yellow seeds with plants that had wrinkled , green seeds .


Then he observed how the two traits showed up in their offspring -LRB- F1 -RRB- .


The wrinkled and green forms of the traits seemed to disappear in the F1 plants .
The wrinkled forms of the traits seemed to disappear in the F1 plants .
The green forms of the traits seemed to disappear in the F1 plants .

Then Mendel let the F1 plants self-pollinate .


The results of Mendels two-trait experiments led to the law of independent assortment .


This law states that factors controlling different traits go to gametes independently of each other .


This explains why F2 plants have all possible combinations of the two traits .


Hed found the answers to age-old questions about heredity .


In fact , Mendels work was largely ignored until 1900 .


Thats when three other scientists independently arrived at Mendels laws .


Only then did people appreciate what a great contribution to science Mendel had made .


Mendels discoveries form the basis of the modern science of genetics .


For his discoveries , Mendel is now called the `` father of genetics . ``


Today we know that the traits of organisms are controlled by genes on chromosomes .


A gene can be defined as a section of a chromosome that contains the genetic code for a particular protein .


In sexually reproducing species , chromosomes are present in cells in pairs .


Chromosomes in the same pair are called homologous chromosomes .


During meiosis , when gametes are produced , homologous chromosomes separate .


Thus , the alleles for each gene also go to different gametes .


The position of a gene on a chromosome is called its locus .


The different versions are called alleles .


Figure 6.6 shows an example in pea plants .


Different alleles account for most of the variation in the traits of organisms within a species .


When gametes unite during fertilization , the resulting zygote inherits two alleles for each gene .


One allele comes from each parent .


Look at Table 6.1 .


The alleles are represented by the letters B -LRB- purple flowers -RRB- and b -LRB- white flowers -RRB- .
The alleles are represented by the letters B -LRB- purple flowers -RRB- .
The alleles are represented by the letters b -LRB- white flowers -RRB- .

A plant with two alleles of the same type -LRB- BB or bb -RRB- is called a homozygote .
A plant with two alleles of the same type -LRB- BB -RRB- is called a homozygote .
A plant with two alleles of the same type -LRB- bb -RRB- is called a homozygote .

A plant with two different alleles -LRB- Bb -RRB- is called a heterozygote .


The expression of an organisms genotype is called its phenotype .


The phenotype refers to the organisms traits , such as purple or white flowers .
The phenotype refers to the organisms traits , such as purple flowers .
The phenotype refers to the organisms traits , such as white flowers .

Different genotypes may produce the same phenotype .


The terms dominant and recessive are the terms Mendel used to describe his `` factors . ``
The terms dominant are the terms Mendel used to describe his `` factors . ``
The terms recessive are the terms Mendel used to describe his `` factors . ``

In a Bb heterozygote , only the dominant B allele is expressed .


The recessive b allele is expressed only in the bb genotype .


Each trait Mendel studied was controlled by one gene with two alleles .


This resulted in just two possible phenotypes for each trait .


Each trait Mendel studied was also controlled by a gene on a different chromosome .


As a result , each trait was inherited independently of the others .


With traits like these , its easy to predict which forms of a trait will show up in the offspring of a given set of parents .


Consider a purple-flowered pea plant with the genotype Bb .


Half the gametes produced by this parent will have a B allele .


This is similar to tossing a coin .


Now lets see what happens if two parent pea plants have the Bb genotype .


Thats because which gametes happen to unite is a matter of chance , like a coin toss .


The Punnett square just shows the possible genotypes and their most likely ratios .
The Punnett square just shows the possible genotypes .
The Punnett square just shows their most likely ratios .

The easiest way to find the answer to these questions is with a Punnett square .


A Punnett square is a chart that makes it easy to find the possible genotypes in offspring of two parents .


The gametes produced by the female parent are along the left side of the chart .


The different possible combinations of alleles in their offspring can be found by filling in the cells of the chart .


But the genotype ratios of their actual offspring may differ .


Inheritance is often more complex than it is for traits like those Mendel studied .


One possibility is called codominance .


Another is called incomplete dominance .


With codominance , both alleles are expressed equally in heterozygotes .


There are three common alleles for the gene that controls this trait .


The possible genotypes and phenotypes for this trait are shown in Table below Genotype AA AO BB BO AB OO Phenotype Type A Type A Type B Type B Type AB Type O
The possible genotypes for this trait are shown in Table below Genotype AA AO BB BO AB OO Phenotype Type A Type A Type B Type B Type AB Type O
The possible phenotypes for this trait are shown in Table below Genotype AA AO BB BO AB OO Phenotype Type A Type A Type B Type B Type AB Type O

Some traits are controlled by more than one gene .


Normal adults may range from less than 5 feet tall to more than 7 feet tall .


Genes play an important role in determining an organisms traits .


However , for many traits , phenotype is influenced by the environment as well .


For example , skin color is controlled by genes but also influenced by exposure to sunlight .
For example , skin color is controlled by genes .
For example , skin color is influenced by exposure to sunlight .

These are chromo - somes that determine the sex of the organism .


All of the other chromosomes are called autosomes .


Genes on sex chromosomes may be inherited differently than genes on autosomes .


In people , the sex chromosomes are called X and Y chromosomes .
In people , the sex chromosomes are called X chromosomes .
In people , the sex chromosomes are called Y chromosomes .

As you can see in Figure sons .


Traits controlled by genes on the sex chromosomes are called sex-linked traits .


One gene on the Y chromosome determines male sex .


Therefore , a recessive X-linked allele is expressed in females only when they inherit two copies of it .


This explains why X-linked recessive traits show up less often in females than males .


None is related to sex .


Traits controlled by genes on the X chromosome are called X-linked traits .


X-linked traits have a different pattern of inheritance than traits controlled by genes on autosomes .


Therefore , a recessive X-linked allele is always expressed in males .


People with this trait cant see red or green colors .
People with this trait cant see red colors .
People with this trait cant see green colors .

A pedigree is a chart that shows how a trait is inherited in a family .


A species genome consists of all of its genetic information .


The human genome consists of the complete set of genes in the human organism .


The Human Genome Project was launched in 1990 .


Another aim of the project was to identify the more than 20,000 human genes and map their locations on chromosomes .
Another aim of the project was to identify the more than 20,000 human genes .

The logo of the Human Genome Project in Figure 6.13 shows that the project brought together experts in many fields .


The Human Genome Project was completed in 2003 .


Its like having a very detailed manual for making a human organism .


Knowing the sequence of the human genome is very useful .


For example , it helps us understand how humans evolved .


It is helping researchers identify and understand genetic disorders .

Sequencing the human genome has increased our knowledge of genetic disorders .


Genetic disorders are diseases caused by mutations .


Many genetic disorders are caused by mutations in a single gene .


Others are caused by abnormal numbers of chromosomes .


Table 6.3 lists some genetic disorders caused by mutations in just one gene .


Hes pictured in Figure 6.14 .


A recessive allele is not expressed in heterozy - gotes .


These people are called carriers .


They dont have the genetic disorder but they carry the recessive allele .
They dont have the genetic disorder .
they carry the recessive allele .

A recessive allele is more likely than a dominant allele to pass to the next generation rather than die out .


A dominant allele is expressed in everybody who inherits even one copy of it .


If it causes a serious disorder , affected people may die young and fail to reproduce .
If it causes a serious disorder , affected people may die young .
If it causes a serious disorder , affected people may fail to reproduce .

They wont pass the allele to the next generation .


As a result , the allele may die out of the population .


This difference in size creates problems .


It increases the chances that the two chromosomes will fail to separate properly during meiosis .


Sometimes , however , errors occur .


The paired chromosomes fail to separate .


When this happens , some gametes get an extra copy of a chromosome .


Other gametes are missing a chromosome .


If one of these gametes is fertilized and survives , a chromosomal disorder results .
If one of these gametes is fertilized , a chromosomal disorder results .
If one of these gametes survives , a chromosomal disorder results .

Treating genetic disorders is one use of biotechnology .


Biotechnology is the use of technology to change the genetic makeup of living things for human purposes .


Besides treating genetic disorders , biotechnology is used to change organisms so they are more useful to people .


Biotechnology uses a variety of methods , but some are commonly used in many applications .

Each time a bacterial cell divides , the inserted gene is copied .


The polymerase chain reaction is a way of making copies of a gene .


The process keeps cycling to make many copies of a gene .


Gene cloning is another way of making copies of a gene .


A gene is inserted into the DNA of a bacterial cell .

This protein is needed to treat diabetes .


The human insulin gene is inserted into bacteria .


The bacteria reproduce rapidly .


Biotechnology is used to treat genetic disorders .


For example , copies of a normal gene might be inserted into a patient with a defective gene .


This is called gene therapy .


create genetically modified organisms -LRB- GMOs -RRB- .


Genes are inserted into plants to give them desirable traits .


This might be the ability to get by with little water .


For example , corn has been created that has a gene for a pesticide .


The corn plants have accidentally cross-pollinated nearby milkweeds .


Monarch butterfly larvae depend on milkweeds for food .


When they eat milkweeds with the pesticide gene , they are poisoned .


This may threaten the survival of the monarch species as well as other species that eat monarchs .


Do the benefits of the genetically modified corn outweigh the risks ?


However , biotechnology also raises many concerns .


For example , some people worry about eating foods that contain GMOs .


They wonder if GMOs might cause health problems .


The person in Figure 6.17 favors the labeling of foods that contain GMOs .


That way , consumers can know which foods contain them and decide for themselves whether to eat them .
That way , consumers can know which foods contain them .
That way , consumers can decide for themselves whether to eat them .

Another concern about biotechnology is how it may affect the environment .


Negative effects on the environment have already occurred because of some GMOs .


They were first discovered in extreme environments such as hot springs .


Scientists still know relatively little about them .


New species of archaeans are being discovered all the time .


Extremophiles are organisms that live in extreme conditions .


Each type is described below .


Extreme conditions pose many challenges to living cells .


Archaeans have evolved adaptations that allow them to deal with the challenges .


For example , some archaeans live around hydrothermal vents .


Boiling hot , highly acidic water pours out of the vent .


These extreme conditions dont deter archaeans .


This suggests that archaeans may have evolved very early in Earths history .


Some archaeans can survive at very high temperatures .


One archaean species can even reproduce at 122 C -LRB- 252 F -RRB- .


It is the highest recorded temperature for any organism .


The most acidophilic archaeans can thrive at negative pH values .


No other organisms can survive in such acidic conditions .


Basic environments where archaeans are found include Mono Lake in California , pictured in Figure 8.17 .


So archaeans that live in the water of Mono Lake must have adaptations to both salty and basic conditions .
So archaeans that live in the water of Mono Lake must have adaptations to both salty conditions .
So archaeans that live in the water of Mono Lake must have adaptations to both basic conditions .

In fact , archaeans are now known to live just about everywhere on Earth .


They make up as much as 20 percent of Earths total mass of living things .


Archaeans have been found in a broad range of habitats .

Crocodilians use several methods of attack when pursuing live prey .


Most other reptiles can only walk in a sprawled position .


This keeps them concealed while they watch for prey that approaches the waters edge .


The crocodilian then lunges out of the water , taking their prey by surprise and dragging it from the shoreline into deep water where the prey is killed .

The crocodilian then lunges out of the water , dragging it from the shoreline into deep water where the prey is killed .

The sex of developing crocodilians is determined by the temperature of the eggs during incubation , when eggs are kept warm before they hatch .


This means that the sex of crocodilians is not determined genetically .


If the eggs are kept at a cold or a hot temperature , then their offspring may be all male or all female .
If the eggs are kept at a cold temperature , then their offspring may be all male .

Female crocodilians care for the young after they hatch , providing them with protection until they grow large enough to defend themselves .


In many species of crocodilians , the female carries her tiny offspring in her mouth .


All crocodilians have , like humans , teeth set in bony sockets .

Most amphibians still need water to lay their eggs .


The life cycle of amphibians happens in the following stages : 1 .


Larval stage : When the egg hatches , the organism is legless , lives in water , and breathes with gills , resembling their evolutionary ancestors -LRB- fish -RRB- .

External fertilization , employed by most frogs , involves a male gripping a female across her back , almost as if he is squeezing the eggs out of her .
External fertilization , employed by most toads , involves a male gripping a female across her back , almost as if he is squeezing the eggs out of her .

The male releases sperm over the females eggs as they are laid .


Another method is used by salamanders , whereby the male deposits a packet of sperm onto the ground .


The female then pulls it into her cloaca , a single opening for her internal organ systems .


Therefore , fertilization occurs internally .

Angiosperms evolved the structure of the flower , so they are also called the flowering plants .


Angiosperms live in a variety of different environments .


Even though flowers may look very different from each other , they do have some structures in common .


The structures are explained in the picture below -LRB- Figure 1.2 -RRB- .


The pollen , which is found at the top of the stamen , is the male gametophyte .


At the very center is the carpel , which is divided into three different parts : -LRB- 1 -RRB- the sticky stigma , where the pollen lands , -LRB- 2 -RRB- the tube of the style , and -LRB- 3 -RRB- the large , bottom part , known as the ovary .


The ovary holds the ovules , the female gametophytes .


When the ovules are fertilized , the ovule becomes the seed and the ovary becomes the fruit .
When the ovules are fertilized , the ovule becomes the seed .

Flowering plants can reproduce two different ways : 1 .


Self-pollination : Pollen falls on the stigma of the same flower .


This way , a seed will be produced that can turn into a genetically identical plant .

An example of a flagellate is Trypanosoma , which causes African sleeping sickness .


Other protists have what are called transient pseudopodia , which are like temporary feet .


The cell surface extends out to form feet-like structures that propel the cell forward .


The ciliates are protists that move by using cilia .


Cilia are thin , very small tail-like projections that extend outward from the cell body .

Characteristics of arthropods include : 1 .


In order to grow , arthropods shed this outer covering in a process called molting .


A series of hearts move the hemolymph into the body cavity where it comes in direct contact with the tissues .


Hemolymph is involved with oxygen distribution .


Aquatic arthropods use gills to exchange gases .


These gills have a large surface area in contact with the water , so they can absorb more oxygen .


Land-living arthropods have internal surfaces that help exchange gasses .


Insects and most other terrestrial species have a tracheal system , where air sacs lead into the body from pores in the exoskeleton .

Applied science is using scientific discoveries , such as those from basic research , to solve practical problems .


Energy must constantly flow through an ecosystem for the system to remain stable .


What exactly does this mean ?


A food chain can not continue to go on and on .
A food chain can not continue to go on .
A food chain can not continue to go on .

This food chain includes producers and consumers .
This food chain includes producers .
This food chain includes consumers .

In an ocean ecosystem , one possible food chain might look like this : phytoplankton krill fish shark .


The producers are always at the beginning of the food chain , bringing energy into the ecosystem .


Through photosynthesis , the producers create their own food in the form of glucose , but also create the food for the other organisms in the ecosystem .
Through photosynthesis , the producers create their own food in the form of glucose .
Through photosynthesis , the producers create the food for the other organisms in the ecosystem .

Essentially , it means that organisms must eat other organisms .


The herbivores come next , then the carnivores .


When these consumers eat other organisms , they use the glucose in those organisms for energy .


In this example , phytoplankton are eaten by krill , which are tiny , shrimp-like animals .


The krill are eaten by fish , which are then eaten by sharks .


Could decomposers be added to a food chain ?


Each organism can eat and be eaten by many different types of organisms , so simple food chains are rare in nature .
Each organism can eat by many different types of organisms , so simple food chains are rare in nature .
Each organism can be eaten by many different types of organisms , so simple food chains are rare in nature .

So a food chain can not end with a shark ; it must end with a distinct species of shark .


A food chain does not contain the general category of `` fish , `` it will contain specific species of fish .


Food chains -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- show the eating patterns in an ecosystem .


Since feeding relationships are so complicated , we can combine food chains together to create a more accurate flow of energy within an ecosystem .


A food web -LRB- Figure 1.2 -RRB- shows the feeding relationships between many organisms in an ecosystem .


If you expand our original example of a food chain , you could add deer that eat clover and foxes that hunt chipmunks .

A food web shows many more arrows , but still shows the flow of energy .
A food web shows many more arrows .
A food web still shows the flow of energy .

A complete food web may show hundreds of different feeding relationships .


Food energy flows from one organism to another .


Arrows are used to show the feeding relationship between the animals .


The arrow points from the organism being eaten to the organism that eats it .


For example , an arrow from a plant to a grasshopper shows that the grasshopper eats the leaves .


Energy and nutrients are moving from the plant to the grasshopper .
Energy are moving from the plant to the grasshopper .
nutrients are moving from the plant to the grasshopper .

Next , a bird might prey on the grasshopper , a snake may eat the bird , and then an owl might eat the snake .

How do birds reproduce ?


We know that chickens lay eggs .


The male brings his sperm to the female cloaca .


The sperm fertilizes the egg .


Then the hard-shelled egg develops within the female .


The hard-shelled eggs have a fluid-filled amnion , a thin membrane forming a closed sac around the embryo .


Eggs are usually laid in a nest .


It all starts with behavior aimed at attracting a mate .


In birds , this will involve a type of display , usually performed by the male .


Some displays are very elaborate and may include dancing , aerial flights , or wing or tail drumming .
Some displays are very elaborate .
Some displays may include dancing .
Some displays may include aerial flights .
Some displays may include wing drumming .
Some displays may include tail drumming .

Most male birds also sing a type of song to attract females .


If they are successful at attracting a female , it will lead to breeding .


Birds reproduce by internal fertilization , during which the egg is fertilized inside the female .


Why do you think eggs come in so many different colors ?


Birds that make nests in the open have camouflaged eggs -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- .


How else might a bird help protect its young from predators ?


Most species locate their nests in areas that are hidden , in order to avoid predators .


Large birds , or those that nest in groups , may build nests in the open , since they are more capable of defending their young .

This gives the eggs protection against predation .


To protect their young , different species of birds make different nests .


Birds of all types , from hummingbirds to ostriches , make nests .


Many can be elaborate , shaped like cups , domes , plates , mounds , or burrows .

However , some birds , like the common guillemot , do not use nests .


Emperor penguins do not have a nest at all ; they sit on eggs to keep them warm before they hatch , a process called incubation .


In birds , 90 % to 95 % of species are monogamous , meaning the male and female remain together for breeding for a few years or until one mate dies .

Since birds often take great care of their young , some birds have evolved a behavior called brood parasitism .


This happens when a bird leaves her eggs in another birds nest .


The host bird often accepts and raises the parasite birds eggs .

Usually , the parents take turns incubating the eggs .


Great Frigatebird adults are known to care for their young for up to 20 months after hatching , the longest in a bird species .


Here , a young bird is begging for food .


Birds usually incubate their eggs after the last one has been laid .

At one extreme , in a group of birds called the magapodes -LRB- which are chicken-like birds -RRB- , parental care ends at hatching .


In this case , the newly - hatched chick digs itself out of the nest mound without parental help and can take care of itself right away .

With approxi - mately 10,000 living species , birds are the most numerous vertebrates with four limbs .


The ostrich can reach a height of nine feet !


Pictured here is an ostrich with her young in the Negev Desert , southern Israel .


What does that mean ?


Almost all birds have forelimbs modified as wings , but not all birds can fly .

In some birds , the wings have evolved into other structures .


The digestive system of birds is unique , with a gizzard that contains swallowed stones for grinding food .

In comparing birds with other vertebrates , what do you think distinguishes them the most ?


A birds wing shape and size will determine how a species flies .
A birds wing shape will determine how a species flies .
A birds wing size will determine how a species flies .

For example , many birds have powered flight at certain times , requiring the flapping of their wings , while at other times they soar , using up less energy -LRB- Figure 1.3 -RRB- .


A flightless cormorant can no longer fly , but it uses its wings for swimming .
A flightless cormorant can no longer fly .
it uses its wings for swimming .

Birds have adapted their body plan for flight : Their skeleton is especially lightweight , with large , air-filled spaces connecting to their respiratory system .


Birds that fly have a bony ridge along the breastbone that the flight muscles attach to -LRB- Figure 1.2 -RRB- .


This allows them to remain stable in the air as they fly .


Birds also have wings that function as an aerofoil .


The surface of the aerofoil is curved to help the bird control and use the air currents to fly .

The health of your whole body depends on the good health of your cardiovascular system .


Blood pressure occurs when circulating blood puts pressure on the walls of blood vessels .


Since blood pressure is primarily caused by the beating of your heart , the walls of the arteries move in a rhythmic fashion .


The pressure of the circulating blood slowly decreases as blood moves from the arteries and into the smaller blood vessels .
The pressure of the circulating blood slowly decreases as blood moves from the arteries .
The pressure of the circulating blood slowly decreases as blood moves into the smaller blood vessels .

Blood pressure is read as two numbers .


Clinical trials have shown that people who have blood pressures at the low end of these ranges have much better long term cardiovascular health .


Blood pressure is measured with a sphygmomanometer -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- .


A digital sphygmomanometer is made of an inflatable cuff and a pressure meter to measure blood pressure .

This reading shows a blood pressure of 126/70 .


Hypertension , which is also called `` high blood pressure , `` occurs when a persons blood pressure is always high .


Hypertension is said to be present when a persons systolic blood pressure is always 140 or higher , and/or if the persons diastolic blood pressure is always 90 or higher .

The diastolic pressure , which is the second number , is when your blood pressure is lowest , when the heart is resting between beats .


Healthy ranges for blood pressure are : Systolic : less than 120 Diastolic : less than 80 Blood pressure is written as systolic/diastolic .


For example , a reading of 120/80 is said as `` one twenty over eighty . ``


These measures of blood pressure can change with each heartbeat and over the course of the day .

MyPyramid -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- is a diagram that shows how much you should eat each day of foods from six different food groups .


It recommends the amount of nutrients you need based on your age , your gender , and your level of activity .


The key shows which food group each color represents .


In MyPyramid , each food group is represented by a band of a different color .


For example , grains are represented by an orange band , and vegetables are represented by a green band .
For example , grains are represented by an orange band .
For example , vegetables are represented by a green band .

This means that you should choose more foods from the grain group than from any other single food group .

Chordates -LRB- phylum Chordata -RRB- are named after a feature they all share , a notochord .


Chordates are defined by a set of four characteristics that are shared by these animals at some point during their development .


In some chordates , all four traits are present in the adult animal and serve important functions .

The lancelet , an example of a chordate , is found in shallow ocean waters .


There are actually five classes of marine chordates -LRB- for example , sharks are cartilaginous fish which are distinct from bony fish -RRB- , and these will be discussed in additional concepts .

these will be discussed in additional concepts .

The chordate phylum is broken down into three subphyla : 1 .


Urochordata : The tunicates , pictured in the introduction , make up this group .


Cephalochordata : Cephalochordates include the lancelets -LRB- Figure 1.2 -RRB- , fish-like marine animals often found half-buried in the sand .


Cnidarians , in the phylum Cnidaria , include organisms such as the jellyfish , corals , and sea anemones .
Cnidarians , in the phylum Cnidaria , include organisms such as the jellyfish .
Cnidarians , in the phylum Cnidaria , include organisms such as corals .
Cnidarians , in the phylum Cnidaria , include organisms such as sea anemones .

These animals are found in shallow ocean water .


Thats because cnidarians have stinging cells known as nematocysts .


Cnidarians use nematocysts to catch their food .


When touched , the nematocysts release a thread of poison that can be used to paralyze prey .


The body plan of cnidarians is unique because these organisms show radial symmetry , making these animals very different from those that evolved before them .


Radial symmetry means that they have a circular body plan , and any cut through the center of the animal leaves two equal halves .

The cnidarians also have nerve tissue organized into a net-like structure , known as a nerve-net , with connected nerve cells dispersed throughout the body .


Some types of cnidarians are also known to form colonies .


Two examples are described below .


The corals are sessile -LRB- non-moving -RRB- polyps that can use their tentacles to feed on ocean creatures that pass by .


Their skeletons are made up of calcium carbonate , which is also known as limestone .


Over long periods of time , their skeletons build on each other to produce large structures known as coral reefs .

Recall that ecology is the study of how living organisms interact with their environment .

But how do organisms interact with each other ?


The organism that is better adapted to that environment is better able to survive .


The other organism may not survive .


In this example , it is the taller tree that is better adapted to the environment .


Interspecific competition happens when individuals of different species strive for a limited resource in the same area .


Since any two species have different traits , one species will be able to out-compete the other .


One species will be better adapted to its environment , and essentially `` win `` the competition .

If prey is limited , then lions may catch more prey than cheetahs .


This will force the cheetahs to either leave the area or suffer a decrease in population .

This will force the cheetahs to either suffer a decrease in population .

Organisms interact with each other through various mechanisms , one of which is competition .


Looking at different types of competition , ecologists developed the competitive exclusion principle .


The principle states that species less suited to compete for resources will either adapt , move from the area , or die out .
The principle states that species less suited to compete for resources will either adapt .
The principle states that species less suited to compete for resources will either move from the area .
The principle states that species less suited to compete for resources will either die out .

In order for two species within the same area to coexist , they may adapt by developing different specializations .


This is known as character displacement .


An example of character displacement is when different birds adapt to eating different types of food .


Therefore , competition for resources within and between species plays an important role in evolution through natural selection .
Therefore , competition for resources within species plays an important role in evolution through natural selection .

Competition occurs when organisms strive for limited resources .


Intraspecific competition happens when members of the same species compete for the same resources .


For example , two trees may grow close together and compete for light .
For example , two trees may grow close together .
For example , two trees may compete for light .

One may out-compete the other by growing taller to get more available light .


As members of the same species are usually genetically different , they have different characteristics , and in this example , one tree grows taller than the other .

in this example , one tree grows taller than the other .

Recall that producers make their own food through photosynthesis .


Herbivores are animals that eat producers to get energy .

So how do these organisms obtain their energy ?


They must eat other organisms , or obtain their energy from these organisms some other way .

Chemical control of pests involves the use of insecticides .


Insecticides , which are also known as pesticides , are most often used to kill insects .


If the answer is no , other methods of control should be considered .


In large scale efforts to rid areas of mosquitoes , the insecticide used also killed the dragonfly .


This effort removed a natural predator of the mosquito .


This may be an unacceptable negative effect of using the insecticide .


If the crop is not heavily damaged , only minor pest control may be needed .


This may affect the amount or type of insecticide used .

Does using the pesticide result in the development of resistance ?


If so , this can make additional use of the pesticide less effective .


As the resistance will be passed to future generations of the insect -LRB- which is natural selection in action -RRB- , this could be considered a negative side-effect of pesticide use .


The U.S. spends $ 9 billion each year on pesticides .


Disadvantages to using pesticides include human , fish , and honeybee poisonings , and the contamination of meat and dairy products .

When choosing to use an insecticide , there are numerous points to consider .


Negative effects of the pesticide should try to be minimized .


Important questions to consider include the following .


Crustaceans are a large group of arthropods , consisting of almost 52,000 species .

Bears can be awakened easily from their winter sleep .


Migration is an innate behavior that is triggered by changes in the environment .


For example , animals may migrate when the days get shorter in the fall .


In the Northern Hemisphere , many species of birds , including robins and geese , travel south for the winter .

An animal uses less energy than usual during hibernation .


A flock of migrating geese is pictured below -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- .


These geese are flying south for the win - ter .


Flocks of geese migrate in V-shaped formations .


Some animals migrate very long distances .


The map shown below shows the migration route of a species of hawk called Swainsons hawk -LRB- Figure 1.2 -RRB- .


About how many miles do the hawks travel from start to finish ?


Are you surprised that birds migrate that far ?


Some species of birds migrate even farther .


Whales also are known to migrate thousands of miles each year to take advantage of warmer waters in the winter months .

Now , scientists know that fungi are not plants at all .


The main difference between plants and fungi is how they obtain energy .


Plants are autotrophs , meaning that they make their own `` food `` using the energy from sunlight .


Fungi are heterotrophs , which means that they obtain their `` food `` from outside of themselves .


Fungi can grow fast because they are such good eaters .


Fungi have lots of surface area , and this large surface area eats or absorbs .
Fungi have lots of surface area .
this large surface area eats .
this large surface area absorbs .

Cells of the fungi then absorb the broken-down nutrients .


Surface area is how much exposed area an organism has , compared to their overall volume .


If you see a mushroom in your yard , that is just a small part of a larger fungus growing underground .


These are the steps involved in fungi `` eating `` : 1 .


Fungi squirt special enzymes into their environment .


The enzymes help digest large organic molecules , similar to cutting up your food before you eat .


Scientists used to think that fungi were members of the plant kingdom .


Plants and fungi live in the same kinds of habitats , such as growing in soil .
Plants live in the same kinds of habitats , such as growing in soil .
fungi live in the same kinds of habitats , such as growing in soil .

However , there are a number of characteristics that make fungi different from plants : 1 .

The Kingdom Fungi can be broken down into several phyla .


Various types of fungi are pictured below -LRB- Table 1.1 -RRB- .


Different fungi reproduce in different ways .


Many fungi reproduce both sexually and asexually .

However , some only asexually .

Asexual reproduction involves just one parent and sexual repro - duction involves two parents .
Asexual reproduction involves just one parent .
sexual repro - duction involves two parents .

Through asexual reproduction , new organisms are produced that are genetically identical to the parent .


Budding : The fungus grows a new part of its body , which eventually breaks off .


The broken-off piece becomes a new organism -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- .


Fragmentation : In this method , a piece of the mycelium , the body of the fungus , splits off .


The resulting fragment can eventually produce a new colony of fungi .


Asexual reproduction is faster and produces more fungi than sexual reproduction .
Asexual reproduction is faster .
Asexual reproduction produces more fungi than sexual reproduction .

This form of reproduction is controlled by many different factors .


Outside conditions , such as the availability of food , determine when a fungus undergoes asexual reproduction .


Fungi reproduce asexually through three methods : 1 .


Spores : Spores are formed by the fungi and released to create new fungi .
Spores : Spores are formed by the fungi .
Spores : Spores are released to create new fungi .

This is the powdery substance released by puffballs .


Spores are haploid reproductive cells found in some bacteria , plants , algae , fungi , and protozoa .

Spores are haploid reproductive cells found in some plants .
Spores are haploid reproductive cells found in some algae .

Spores are haploid reproductive cells found in some protozoa .

Theoretically , spores can reproduce asexually to produce countless offspring .


Obviously this does not happen .


If it did , the world would be covered by genetically identical fungi .


But why reproduce sexually when asexual reproduction is much quicker ?


Sexual reproduction brings together traits from the two parents .


This increases the genetic diversity of the species .


In plants and animals , sexual reproduction occurs when sperm and egg from two parents join to make a new individual .
In plants , sexual reproduction occurs when sperm from two parents join to make a new individual .

The common mushroom , a fruiting body , results after sexual reproduction when two hyphae , one -LRB- + -RRB- and one -LRB- - -RRB- , mate , forming a mycelium with sporangia .


No - tice , when the sporangia burst , the spores are released from the fruiting body .

Ginkgoes , in the phylum Ginkgophyta , are unique because they are the only species left in the phylum .


Many other species in the fossil record have gone extinct -LRB- Figure 1.4 -RRB- .


One reason the ginkgo tree may have survived is because it was often grown around Buddhist temples , especially in China .


The ginkgo tree is also a popular landscape tree today in American cities because it can live in polluted areas better than most plants .


The male trees are usually preferred for landscaping because the seeds produced by the female plants smell terrible when they ripen .

Each organism plays a particular role in its ecosystem .


A niche is the role a species plays in the ecosystem .


They can have very similar niches , which can overlap , but there must be distinct differences between any two niches .
They can have very similar niches , which can overlap .
there must be distinct differences between any two niches .

If two species do fill the same niche , they will compete for all necessary resources .

Sometimes the native species may go extinct .

For example , kudzu , a Japanese vine , was planted in the southeastern United States in the 1870s to help control soil loss .


Kudzu had no natural predators , so it was able to out-compete native species of vine and take over their niches -LRB- Figure 1.2 -RRB- .

In other words , a niche is how an organism makes a living .


A niche will include the organisms role in the flow of energy through the ecosystem .


This involves how the organism gets its energy , which usually has to do with what an organism eats , and how the organism passes that energy through the ecosystem , which has to do with what eats the organism .

An organisms niche also includes its role in recycling nutrients .

Once a niche is left vacant , other organisms can fill that position .


For example when the Tarpan , a small wild horse found mainly in southern Russia , became extinct in the early 1900s , its niche was filled by a small horse breed , the Konik -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- .


Often this occurs as a new species evolves to occupy the vacant niche .


A species niche must be specific to that species ; no two species can fill the same niche .

The Flint Hills contain some of the largest remnants of tallgrass prairie habitat remaining in North America .


Other habitats that are being rapidly destroyed are forests , especially tropical rainforests .


The largest cause of deforestation today is slash-and-burn agriculture -LRB- shown in the opening image -RRB- .


At current rates of deforestation , all tropical forests will be gone by the year 2090 .


This means that when people want to turn a forest into a farm , they cut down all of the trees and then burn the remainder of the forest .

Also , some coral reef formations in the Indian Ocean are completely lost .


In Europe , many wetland species have gone extinct .


For example , many bogs in Scotland have been lost because of human development .


Another example of species loss due to habitat destruction happened on Madagascars central highland plateau .


From 1970 to 2000 , slash-and-burn agriculture destroyed about 10 % of the countrys total native plants .

What can happen to an ecosystem if just one species goes extinct ?


Would the loss of a producer have an effect on all the organisms that relied on that producer ?


If a decomposer vanishes , are there other decomposers to fill the void ?


Maybe the resulting species will adapt .


Other species may fill in the niche left by the extinct species .


But the extinction of one species could have a `` domino `` effect , resulting in the extinction of other species .


This could greatly effect the stability of the whole ecosystem .

Recently , some marine ecosystems have been overrun by seaweed .


Excess seaweed can destroy entire reefs .


Scientists believe that the extinction of large quantities of echinoderms has caused this destruction -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- .


This allows more organisms to live there .


In addition , starfish prevent the growth of algae on coral reefs .


This allows the coral to filter-feed more easily .

The following methods of learning will be explored below : 1 .


Learned behavior can be changed if conditions change .


Habituation -LRB- forming a habit -RRB- Observational learning Conditioning Play Insight learning


For example , you probably know the route from your house to your school .


Assume that you moved to a new house in a different place , so you had to take a different route to school .


What if following the old route was an innate behavior ?


Fortunately , it is a learned behavior .


Habituation is learning to get used to something after being exposed to it for a while .


Habituation usually involves getting used to something that is annoying or frightening , but not dangerous .

Habituation usually involves getting used to something that is dangerous .

The crows landing on this scarecrow have become used to a human in this place .


They have learned that the scarecrow poses no danger .


It lets animals ignore things that will not harm them .


Without habituation , animals might waste time and energy trying to escape from things that are not really dangerous .

An older child might learn to study for tests in school by being rewarded with better grades .


A toddler might be punished with a time-out each time he grabs a toy from his baby brother .


A dog might be scolded each time she jumps up on the sofa .


A bird might become ill after eating a poisonous insect .


The bird may learn from this punishment to avoid eating the same kind of insect in the future .


Another example of conditioning is shown in the video below ; the rats have been taught to play basketball by being rewarded with food pellets .


URL : Conditioning also occurs in wild animals .


For example , bees learn to find nectar in certain types of flowers because they have found nectar in those flowers before .


Humans learn behaviors through conditioning , as well .


A young child might learn to put away his toys by being rewarded with a bedtime story .


Most young mammals , including humans , like to play .


Play is one ways they learn the skills that they will need as adults .

What do you think they are learning by playing together this way ?


Other young animals play in different ways .


It usually involves coming up with new ways to solve problems .


In fact , tool-making was believed to set humans apart from all other animals .


In 1960 , primate expert Jane Goodall discovered that chimpanzees also make tools .


After termites climbed onto the twig , he pulled the twig out of the hole and ate the insects clinging to it .
After termites climbed onto the twig , he pulled the twig out of the hole .
After termites climbed onto the twig , he ate the insects clinging to it .

The chimpanzee had made a tool to fish for termites .


Since then , chimpanzees have been seen making several different types of tools .


Scientists have also observed other species of animals making tools to solve problems .


A crow was seen bending a piece of wire into a hook .


Then the crow used the hook to pull food out of a tube .


An example of a gorilla using a walking stick is shown below -LRB- Figure 1.4 -RRB- .

On the other hand , a few species of lizards exclusively eat plants .


A long tail , which they can shed in order to escape from predators .


Vision , including color vision , is well-developed in lizards .


You may have seen a lizard camouflaged to blend in with its surroundings .


Since they have great vision , lizards communicate by changing the color of their bodies .


They also communicate with chemical signals called pheromones .


Have you ever tried catching a lizard ?


Some can run on two feet , such as the collared lizard .


Some , like the basilisk , can even run across the surface of water to escape danger .


Many lizards can change color in response to their environments or in times of stress -LRB- Figure 1.3 -RRB- .

Some lizard species , including the glass lizard and flap-footed lizards , have evolved to lose their legs , or their legs are so small that they no longer work .
Some lizard species , including the glass lizard .
flap-footed lizards , have evolved to lose their legs .
their legs are so small that they no longer work .

This provides these species an evolutionary advantage in their way of life .


Legless lizards almost look like snakes , though structures leftover from earlier stages of evolution remain .


For example , flap-footed lizards can be distinguished from snakes by their external ears .


The more than 2,700 species of snake can be found on every continent except Antarctica and range in size from the tiny , 4-inch-long thread snake to pythons , to the over 17-foot-long anaconda -LRB- Figure 1.4 -RRB- .

Snakes that are kept as pets can have their venom removed without affecting the health of the snake .


Most snakes use specialized belly scales , which grip surfaces to move -LRB- Figure 1.5 -RRB- .


In the shedding of scales , known as molting , the complete outer layer of skin is shed in one layer -LRB- Figure 1.6 -RRB- .

An organism goes extinct when no more members remain .

Two of the largest extinctions are described below : The fossil of Tarbosaurus , one of the land dinosaurs that went extinct during one of the mass extinctions .


At the end of the Permian Period , it is estimated that about 99.5 % of individual organisms went extinct !


Up to 95 % of marine species perished , compared to only 70 % of land species .


Some scientists theorize that the extinction was caused by the formation of Pangaea , or one large continent made out of many smaller ones .

Some scientists theorize that the extinction was caused by the formation of one large continent made out of many smaller ones .

One large continent has a smaller shoreline than many small ones , so reducing the shoreline space may have The supercontinent Pangaea encompassed all of todays continents in a single land mass .


This configuration limited shallow coastal areas which harbor marine species .


This may have contributed to the dramatic event which ended the Permianthe most massive extinction ever recorded .


At the end of the Cretaceous Period , or 65 million years ago , all dinosaurs -LRB- except those which led to birds -RRB- went extinct .


Some scientists believe a possible cause is a collision between the Earth and a comet or asteroid .

A decrease in photosynthesis would have resulted in less plant food , leading to the extinction of the dinosaurs .


Evidence for the extinction of dinosaurs by asteroid includes an iridium-rich layer in the Earth , dated at 65.5 million years ago .


Maybe the asteroid that hit the Earth left the iridium behind .


After each mass extinction , new species evolve to fill the habitats where old species lived .


This is well documented in the fossil record .


Only those individuals with the traits needed to live in a changed environment survive -LRB- Survival of the Fittest -RRB- -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- .


Mass extinctions , such as the extinction of dinosaurs and many marine mammals , happened after major catastrophes such as volcanic eruptions and earthquakes -LRB- Figure 1.2 -RRB- .

Since life began on Earth , there have been several major mass extinctions .


If you look closely at the geological time scale , you will find that at least five major mass extinctions have occurred in the past 540 million years .


In each mass extinction , over 50 % of animal species died .


Though species go extinct frequently , a mass extinction in which such a high percentage of species go extinct is rare .


Do you remember what happened when Mendel crossed purple flowered-plants and white flowered-plants ?
Do you remember what happened when Mendel crossed purple flowered-plants ?
Do you remember what happened when Mendel crossed white flowered-plants ?

Mendel had to come up with a theory of inheritance to explain his results .


Mendel proposed that each pea plant had two hereditary factors for each trait .


Mendel developed his theories without an under - standing of DNA , or even the knowledge that DNA existed .
Mendel developed his theories without an under - standing of DNA .
Mendel developed his theories without the knowledge that DNA existed .

If one of these purple flowers is crossed with a white flower , all the offspring will have purple flowers .


The other trait that is masked is called the recessive factor , meaning that when both factors are present , only the effects of the dominant factor are noticeable -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- .


Although you have two hereditary factors for each trait , each parent can only pass on one of these factors to the offspring .


When the sex cells , or gametes -LRB- sperm or egg -RRB- , form , the heredity factors must separate , so there is only one factor per gamete .
When the sex cells , form , the heredity factors must separate , so there is only one factor per gamete .
When the gametes -LRB- sperm -RRB- , form , the heredity factors must separate , so there is only one factor per gamete .
When the gametes -LRB- egg -RRB- , form , the heredity factors must separate , so there is only one factor per gamete .

In other words , the factors are `` segregated `` in each gamete .


Mendels law of segregation states that the two hereditary factors separate when gametes are formed .


When fertilization occurs , the offspring receive one hereditary factor from each gamete , so the resulting offspring have two factors .


The law of segregation predates our understanding or meiosis .
The law of segregation predates our understanding .
The law of segregation predates our meiosis .

This law explains what Mendel had seen in the F1 generation when a tall plant was crossed with a short plant .


When the F1 generation -LRB- Tt -RRB- is allowed to self-pollinate , each parent will give one factor -LRB- T or t -RRB- to the F2 generation .
When the F1 generation -LRB- Tt -RRB- is allowed to self-pollinate , each parent will give one factor -LRB- T -RRB- to the F2 generation .
When the F1 generation -LRB- Tt -RRB- is allowed to self-pollinate , each parent will give one factor -LRB- t -RRB- to the F2 generation .

According to the laws of probability , 25 % of the offspring would be tt , so they would appear short .


Each individual in the F1 would have one of each factor , and as the tall factor is dominant to the short factor -LRB- the recessive factor -RRB- , all the plants appeared tall .
Each individual in the F1 would have one of each factor .
as the tall factor is dominant to the short factor -LRB- the recessive factor -RRB- , all the plants appeared tall .

In describing genetic crosses , letters are used .


The dominant factor is represented with a capital letter -LRB- T for tall -RRB- while the recessive factor is represented by a lowercase letter -LRB- t -RRB- .


Since T is dominant to t , plants that are Tt will be tall because the dominant factor masks the recessive factor .


As each parent gives one factor to the F1 generation , all of the F1 generation will be Tt tall plants .


What does the word `` inherit `` mean ?


Furthermore , pea plants grow quickly , so he could complete many experiments in a short period of time .


Mendel also used pea plants because they can either self-pollinate or be cross-pollinated .
Mendel also used pea plants because they can either self-pollinate .
Mendel also used pea plants because they can either be cross-pollinated .

Self-pollination means that only one flower is involved ; the flowers own pollen lands on the female sex organs .


Cross pollination is done by hand by moving pollen from one flower to the stigma of another -LRB- just like bees do naturally -RRB- .


As a result , one plants sex cells combine with another plants sex cells .


This is called a `` cross . ``


These crosses produce offspring Gregor Mendel , the `` father `` of genetics .


Since Mendel could move pollen between plants , he could carefully control and then observe the results of crosses between two different types of plants .


To inherit is to receive something from someone who came before you .


He studied the inheritance patterns for many different traits in peas , including round seeds versus wrinkled seeds , white flowers versus purple flowers , and tall plants versus short plants .
He studied the inheritance patterns for many different traits in peas , including round seeds versus wrinkled seeds .

He studied the inheritance patterns for many different traits in peas , including tall plants versus short plants .

The field of genetics seeks to explain how traits are passed on from one generation to the next .


In the late 1850s , an Austrian monk named Gregor Mendel -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- performed the first genetics experiments .


To study genetics , Mendel chose to work with pea plants because they have easily identifiable traits -LRB- Figure 1.2 -RRB- .


For example , pea plants are either tall or short , which is an easy trait to observe .
For example , pea plants are either tall , which is an easy trait to observe .
For example , pea plants are either short , which is an easy trait to observe .

What do you predict the offspring of these plants were ?


In all , Mendel studied seven characteristics , with almost 20,000 F2 plants analyzed .


Do you think the colors blended ?


Most people during Mendels time would have said medium-sized .


But an unexpected result occurred .


Mendel observed that the offspring of this cross -LRB- called the F1 generation -RRB- were all tall plants !


Next , Mendel let the F1 generation self-pollinate .


That means the tall plant offspring were crossed with each other .


Shortness skipped a generation .


Does evolution only happen gradually through small changes ?


Or is it possible that drastic environmental changes can cause new species to evolve ?


Or can both small and large changes occur ?
Or can both small changes occur ?
Or can both large changes occur ?

Some evolutionary changes do not create new species , but result in changes at the population level .
Some evolutionary changes do not create new species .
Some evolutionary changes result in changes at the population level .

A population is a group of organisms of the same species that live in the same area -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- .


A species is a group of organisms that have similar characteristics -LRB- they are genetically similar -RRB- and can mate with one another to produce fertile offspring .

A species is a group of organisms that can mate with one another to produce fertile offspring .

This school of fish are considered mem - bers of the same species because they are able to mate with one another .


They are also considered a population because they live in the same part of the ocean .


Most evolutionary changes are small and do not lead to the creation of a new species .
Most evolutionary changes are small .
Most evolutionary changes do not lead to the creation of a new species .

This is an example of microevolution because the number of mosquitoes with this trait changed .


However , this evolutionary change did not create a new species of mosquito because the pesticide-resistant mosquitoes can still reproduce with other non-pesticide-resistant mosquitoes .


When populations change in small ways over time , the process is called microevolution .


Microevolution results in changes within a species .


An example of microevolution is the evolution of mosquitoes that can not be killed by pesticides , called pesticide - resistant mosquitoes .


Imagine that you have a pesticide that kills most of the mosquitoes in your state .


As a result of the widespread use of this pesticide , most of the remaining mosquitoes are the pesticide-resistant mosquitoes .


When these mosquitoes repro - duce the next year , they produce more mosquitoes with the pesticide-resistant trait .


Macroevolution refers to much bigger evolutionary changes that result in new species .


Macroevolution may happen : 1 .


When microevolution occurs repeatedly over a long period of time and leads to the creation of a new species .

What exactly are the dominant and recessive factors that determine how all organisms look ?

Since Mendels time , scientists have discovered the answers to these questions .


Genetic material is made out of DNA .


It is the DNA that makes up the hereditary factors that Mendel identified .


Recall that our DNA is wound into chromosomes .


Each of our chromosomes contains a long chain of DNA that encodes hundreds , if not thousands , of genes .


These variants of genes are called alleles .


Each parent only donates one allele for each gene to an offspring .


For example , remember that for the height gene in pea plants there are two possible factors .


Genotype is a way to describe the combination of alleles that an individual has for a certain gene -LRB- Table 1.1 -RRB- .


Lets see .


Remember , the recessive phenotype will be expressed only when the dominant allele is absent , or when an individual is homozygous recessive -LRB- tt -RRB- -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- .

The theory of evolution by natural selection means that the inherited traits of a population change over time .


Inherited traits are features that are passed from one generation to the next .


If all of the short necked tortoises die , and the long-necked tortoises survive , then , over time , only the long-necked trait will be passed down to offspring .

Inherited traits are influenced by genes , which are passed on to offspring and future genera - tions .

Inherited traits are influenced by genes , which are passed on to future genera - tions .

Things not influenced by genes are not passed on to your offspring .


Natural selection only operates on traits like ear - lobe shape that have a genetic basis , not on traits that are acquired , like a summer tan .

Organisms that are not well-adapted , for whatever reason , to their environment , will naturally have less of a chance of surviving and reproducing .

Evolution occurs by natural selection .


Take the giant tortoises on the Galpagos Islands as an example .


If a short-necked tortoise lives on an island with fruit located at a high level , will the short-necked tortoise survive ?


Scientists estimate that there are between 5 million and 30 million species on the planet .

Remember that a gametophyte is haploid , having only one set of chromosomes .


The gametophyte produces the gametes that , after fertilization , develop into the diploid sporophyte with two sets of chromosomes .


The sporophyte forms a capsule , called the sporangium , which releases spores -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- .

People have been concerned with classifying organisms for thousands of years .

He invented the way we name organisms today , with each organism having a two word name .

The main categories that biologists use are listed here from the most specific to the least specific category -LRB- Figure 1.3 -RRB- .


All organisms can be classified into one of three domains , the least specific grouping .


All life is divided among six kingdoms : Kingdom Bacteria , Kingdom Archaea , Kingdom Protista , Kingdom Plantae , Kingdom Fungi , and Kingdom Animalia .

Even though naming species is straightforward , deciding if two organisms are the same species can sometimes be difficult .


Linnaeus defined each species by the distinctive physical characteristics shared by these organisms .


But two members of the same species may look quite different .


For example , people from different parts of the world sometimes look very different , but we are all the same species -LRB- Figure 1.4 -RRB- .

A species is defined as a group of similar individuals that can interbreed with one another and produce fertile offspring .
A species is defined as a group of similar individuals that can interbreed with one another .

A species does not produce fertile offspring with other species .


The creation of a new species is called speciation .

There are two main ways that speciation happens naturally .


Both processes create new species by reproductively isolating populations of the same species from each other .


Organisms can be geographically isolated or isolated by a behavior .

Over a long period of time , usually thousands of years , each of the isolated populations evolves in a different direction , forming distinct species .

Here are two examples of allopatric speciation : Darwin observed thirteen distinct finch species on the Galpagos Islands that had evolved from the same ancestor .


Different finch populations lived on separate islands with different environments .


Later , scientists were able to determine which finches had evolved into distinct species by bringing members of each population together .


The birds that could not mate were a separate species .


When the Grand Canyon in Arizona formed , two populations of one squirrel species were separated by the giant canyon .


Sympatric speciation occurs when groups from the same species stop mating because of something other than physical or geographic separation .

Sympatric speciation occurs when groups from the same species stop mating because of something other than geographic separation .

The behavior of two groups that live in the same region is an example of such separation .


The separation may be caused by different mating seasons , for example .


Sympatric speciation is more difficult to identify .

The actual role of abscisic acid is to close the stomata , the tiny openings in leaves that allow substances to leave .

When a plant is stressed due to lack of water , abscisic acid tells the stomata to close .


This prevents water loss through the stomata .


When the environment is not good for a seed to germinate , abscisic acid signals for the dormancy period of the seed to continue .


Abscisic acid also tells the buds of plants to stay in the dormancy stage .


When conditions improve , the levels of abscisic acid drop and the levels of gibberellins increase , signaling that is time to break dormancy -LRB- Figure

Auxins are hormones that play a role in plant growth .


Auxins produced at the tip of the plant are involved in apical dominance , when the main central stem grows more strongly than other stems and branches .
Auxins produced at the tip of the plant are involved in apical dominance , when the main central stem grows more strongly than other stems .
Auxins produced at the tip of the plant are involved in apical dominance , when the main central stem grows more strongly than other branches .

When the tip of the plant is removed , the auxins are no longer present , and the side branches begin to grow .


This is why pruning a plant by cutting off the main branches helps produce a fuller plant with more branches .


Auxins are also involved in tropisms , responses to stimuli in the environment

The grass they eat grows back , so there is no real effect on the population .


In the ocean , kelp -LRB- a type of seaweed -RRB- can regrow after being eaten by fish .


Predators play an important role in an ecosystem .


For example , if they did not exist , then a single species could become dominant over others .


Grazers on a grassland keep grass from growing out of control .


For example , if all of the wolves are removed from a population , then the population of deer or rabbits may increase .

You can think about protists as all eukaryotic organisms that are neither animals , nor plants , nor fungi .


Although Ernst Haeckel set up the Kingdom Protista in 1866 , this kingdom was not accepted by the scientific world until the 1960s .


These unique organisms can be so different from each other that sometimes Protista is called the junk drawer `` kingdom .


Just like a junk drawer , which contains items that dont fit into any other category , this kingdom contains the eukaryotes that can not be put into any other kingdom .


Therefore , protists can seem very different from one another .


Most protists are so small that they can be seen only with a microscope .


For example , kelp is a multicellular protist that can grow to be over 100-meters long -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- .


Multicellular protists , however , do not show cellular specialization or differentiation into tissues .

The whipping of the flagellum creates a current that brings food into the protist .


Other animal-like protists must `` swallow `` their food through a process called endocytosis .


Endocytosis happens when a cell takes in substances through its membrane .


The process is described below : 1 .


The protist wraps around its prey , which is usually bacteria .


The protist produces toxins which paralyze its prey .

Recall the diploid stage is called the sporophyte .

The life cycle of nonvascular seedless plants can be described as follows : 1 .


The male gametophyte produces flagellated sperm that must swim to the egg formed by the female game - tophyte .


For this reason , sexual reproduction must happen in the presence of water .


Therefore , nonvascular plants tend to live in moist environments .


Though the life of a nonvascular seedless plant is a cycle , this can be considered the initial step in the life cycle .


The ferns sporangia , where spores are produced , are often on the underside of the fronds -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- .


Like nonvascular plants , ferns also have flagellated sperm that must swim to the egg .


Unlike nonvascular plants , once fertilization takes place , the gametophyte will die , and the sporophyte will live independently .

Traits that help animals have offspring increase their fitness .

As the genes that encode these traits are passed to the next generation , the traits will become more common in the population .


In many species , females choose the male they will mate with .


For their part , males try to be chosen as mates .


He is doing a dance to attract a female for mating .


You can watch the following video of a blue-footed booby doing his courtship dance at : .


URL : Courtship behaviors occur in many other species .


For example , males in some species of whales have special mating songs to attract females as mates .


Frogs croak for the same reason .


Male deer clash antlers to court females .


Male jumping spiders jump from side to side to attract mates .


A display behavior is a fixed set of actions that carries a specific message .


Although many display behaviors are used to attract mates , some display behaviors have other purposes .


For example , display behaviors may be used to warn other animals to stay away , as you will read below .


To be chosen as a mate , males may perform courtship behaviors .


Male courtship behaviors get the attention of females and show off a males traits .

Caring for the young may include making a nest or other shelter .
Caring for the young may include making a nest .
Caring for the young may include making other shelter .

For example , meerkat parents teach their pups how to eat scorpions without being stung .


Caring for offspring increases their chances of surviving .


Birds called killdeers have an interesting way of protecting their chicks .


When a predator gets too close to her nest , a mother killdeer pretends to have a broken wing .


The mother walks away from the nest holding her wing as though it were injured -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- .


The predator thinks she is injured and will be easy prey .
The predator thinks she is injured .
The predator will be easy prey .

The mother leads the predator away from the nest and then flies away .

The red breast of this male robin is easy to see .


The robin displays his bright red chest to defend his territory .


It warns other robins to keep out of his area .


Some animals deposit chemicals to mark the boundary of their territory .


This is why dogs urinate on fire hydrants and other objects .

Different salamanders breathe in different ways .


In those that have gills , breathing occurs through the gills as water passes over the gill slits .


Sirens keep their gills all their lives , which allows them to breathe underwater .


Species that live on land lose their gills as they grow older .


These salamanders develop lungs that are used in breathing , much like breathing in mammals .


These are called lungless salamanders .


This requires blood vessels that exchange gases to be spread throughout the skin .


However , some can reach a foot or more , as in the mudpuppy of North America .


In Japan and China , the giant salamander reaches 6 feet and weighs up to 66 pounds -LRB- Figure 1.2 -RRB- .

The legs on four-legged salamanders are so short that the salamander belly drags on the ground as the animal walks .


Sirens have long , strong tails that are flat to help sirens swim like a fish , with the tail swinging from side to side .

Scientists use the scientific method so they can find information .


A common method allows all scientists to answer questions in a similar way .


Scientists who use this method can reproduce another scientists experiments .


Almost all versions of the scientific method include the following steps , although some scientists do use slight variations .


Imagine that you are a scientist .


While collecting water samples at a local pond , you notice a frog with five legs instead of four -LRB- Figure 1.2 -RRB- .


One frog even has limbs coming out of its mouth .


These are your observations , or things you notice about an environment using your five senses .
These are your observations .
These are things you notice about an environment using your five senses .

The next step is to ask a question about the frogs .


You may ask , `` Why are so many frogs deformed ? ``


Or , `` Is there something in their environment causing these defects , like water pollution ? ``


What if many of the frogs found in ponds and lakes all over the world have similar deformities ?
What if many of the frogs found in ponds all over the world have similar deformities ?
What if many of the frogs found in lakes all over the world have similar deformities ?

So besides finding out why the frogs are deformed , you should also ask : `` Is the percentage of deformed frogs in this pond greater than the percentage of deformed frogs in other places ? ``


For example , is anyone else doing research on deformed frogs ?


Do you think that you should repeat their research to see if it can be duplicated ?


A hypothesis is a proposed explanation that tries to explain an observation .


Provide measurable results .


Provide yes or no answers .
Provide yes answers .
Provide no answers .

For example , do you think the following hypothesis meets the four criteria above ?


Hypothesis : `` The number of deformed frogs in five ponds that are polluted with chemical X is higher than the number of deformed frogs in five ponds without chemical X. ``


For example , you might hypothesize that a pesticide from a nearby farm is running into the pond and causing frogs to have extra legs .
For example , you might hypothesize that a pesticide from a nearby farm is running into the pond .

Thats a prediction you can test by measuring pesticide levels in two sets of ponds , those with deformed frogs .
Thats a prediction you can test by measuring pesticide levels in two sets of ponds , those with nothing but healthy frogs .

Every hypothesis needs to be written in a way that it can : 1 .


Be tested using experiments to collect evidence .


To test the hypothesis , an experiment will be done .


You would count the healthy and deformed frogs and measure the amount of chemical X in all of the ponds .
You would measure the amount of chemical X in all of the ponds .
You would count the healthy frogs .
You would count the deformed frogs .

Doing an experiment will test most hypotheses .


The experiment may generate evidence in support of the hypothesis .


The experiment may also generate evidence proving the hypothesis false .


Once you collect your data , it will need to be analyzed .


If a hypothesis and experiment are well designed , the experiment will produce results that you can measure , collect , and analyze .

Your results demonstrate that your hypothesis is false .


This gives you new information that will help you decide what to do next .


Even if the results supported your hypothesis , you would probably ask a new question to try to better understand what is happening to the frogs and why .

Their findings may also be communicated to journalists .


A summery video of the scientific method , using the identification of DNA structure as an example , is shown in this video by MIT students : .


One goal of a scientist is to find answers to scientific questions .


To do this , scientists first develop a hypothesis , which is a proposed explanation that tries to explain an observation .


Looking at the image below might be confusing at first because this evidence seems to defy the law of gravity -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- .


Of course water can not be poured out of bottle and flow upward .
Of course water can not be poured out of bottle .
Of course water can not be flow upward .

The law of gravity is a scientific law , which is a statement describing what always happens under certain conditions in nature .


Scientific laws are developed from lots of collected information .


If many experiments are performed , and lots of evidence is collected in support of a general hypothesis , a scientific theory can be developed .
If many experiments are performed , a scientific theory can be developed .

Scientific theories usually have a lot of evidence in support of the theory , and no evidence disproving the theory .
Scientific theories usually have a lot of evidence in support of the theory .
Scientific theories usually have no evidence disproving the theory .

Scientific theories produce information that helps us understand our world .


For example , the idea that matter is made up of atoms is a scientific theory .


To collect evidence to support -LRB- or disprove -RRB- their hypothesis , scientists must do experiments .


Scientists accept this theory as a fundamental principle of basic science .


A scientific theory must stand up to all scientific testing .


Thus , when scientists find new evidence , they can change their theories .


The data resulting from an experiment .


For example , an apple falling to the ground is evidence in support of the law of gravity .


Modern science is a way of understanding the physical world , based on observable evidence , reasoning , and repeated testing .
Modern science is a way of understanding the physical world , based on observable evidence .
Modern science is a way of understanding the physical world , based on reasoning .

That means scientists explain the world based on their own observations .


If they develop new ideas about the way the world works , they set up a way to test these new ideas .

On the other side of the jungle , you find a group of chimpanzees that are mysteriously dying .


What questions might you ask ?


A good scientist might ask the following two questions : 1 .


`` What differs between the two environments where the chimpanzees live ? ``


Scientists make detailed observations : To observe means to watch and study attentively .

A person untrained in the sciences may only observe , `` The chimps on one side of the jungle are dying , while chimps on the other side of the jungle are healthy . ``


A scientist , however , will make more detailed observations .


Thinking like a scientist is based on asking and answering questions .

Can you think of ways to make this observation more detailed ?


A good scientist may observe , `` While all seven adult females and three adult males on the north side of the jungle are healthy and show normal behavior , four female and five male chimps under the age of five on the south side have died . ``
A good scientist may observe , `` While all seven adult females and three adult males on the north side of the jungle are healthy , four female chimps under the age of five on the south side have died . ``

Detailed observations can ultimately help scientists design their experiments and answer their questions .
Detailed observations can ultimately help scientists design their experiments .
Detailed observations can ultimately help scientists answer their questions .

From these observations , a scientist will develop a hypothesis to explain the observations .


A hypothesis is the scientists proposed explanation for his observations .


The scientists hypothesis may be that `` Young chimps on the south side die due to a lack of nutrients in their diet . ``


Scientists find answers using tests : When scientists want to answer a question , they search for evidence using experiments .


An experiment is a test to see if their explanation is right or wrong .
An experiment is a test to see if their explanation is right .
An experiment is a test to see if their explanation is wrong .

Evidence is made up of the observations a scientist makes during an experiment .


To study the cause of death in the chimpanzees , scientists may give the chimps nutrients in the form of nuts , berries , and vitamins to see if they are dying from a lack of food .
To study the cause of death in the chimpanzees , scientists may give the chimps nutrients in the form of nuts to see if they are dying from a lack of food .

To study the cause of death in the chimpanzees , scientists may give the chimps nutrients in the form of vitamins to see if they are dying from a lack of food .

If fewer chimps die , then the experiment shows that the chimps may have died from not having enough food .


Scientists question the answers : Good scientists are skeptical .


Scientists never use only one piece of evidence to form a conclusion .


Scientists ask questions , and then make detailed observations to try to ask more specific questions and develop a hypothesis .

For example , the chimpanzees in the experiment may have died from a lack of food , but can you think of another explanation for their death ?


More experiments need to be completed before scientists can be sure .


Science is about finding the truth , no matter what .


So good scientists constantly question their own conclusions .


They also find other scientists to confirm or disagree with their evidence .

From the results of their experiment , scientists draw conclusions .


A conclusion describes what the evidence tells the scientist .


Scientists ask questions : The key to being a great scientist is to ask questions .


Imagine you are a scientist in the African Congo .


Have you seen the leaves of plants change colors ?


During what time of year does this happen ?


Thats why , in the winter , it starts getting dark very early in the evening , and then stays dark while youre getting ready for school the next morning .

But in the summer the sun will not set until late that night .

With a light-sensitive chemical , plants can sense the differences in day length .


For example , in the fall , when the days start to get shorter , the trees sense that there is less sunlight .


The plant is stimulated , and it sends messages telling the leaves to change colors and fall .

Many flowering plants sense the length of night , a dark period , as a signal to flower .


Flowering plants are classified as long-day plants or short-day plants .

And , in the spring , the leaves start to grow .

How do plants detect time of year ?


Although you might detect seasonal changes by the change in temperature , this is not the way in which plants know the seasons are changing .


Plants determine the time of year by the length of daylight , known as the photoperiod .


Plants seem to grow wherever they can .


So how does a plant start growing in a new area ?


If youve ever seen a plant grow from a tiny seed , then you might realize that seeds are amazing structures .


A seed is a plant ovule containing an embryo .


The seed allows a plant embryo to survive droughts , harsh winters , and other conditions that would kill an adult plant .
The seed allows a plant embryo to survive droughts .
The seed allows a plant embryo to survive harsh winters .

The tiny plant embryo can simply stay dormant , in a resting state , and wait for the perfect environment to begin to grow .
The tiny plant embryo can simply stay dormant , in a resting state , .
The tiny plant embryo can simply wait for the perfect environment to begin to grow .

In fact , some seeds can stay dormant for hundreds of years !


Another impressive feature of the seed is that it stores food for the young plant after it sprouts .


This greatly increases the chances that the tiny plant will survive .


So being able to produce a seed is a beneficial adaptation , and , as a result , seed plants have been very successful .
So being able to produce a seed is a beneficial adaptation .

For a seed plant species to be successful , the seeds must be dispersed , or scattered around in various directions .
For a seed plant species to be successful , the seeds must be dispersed .
For a seed plant species to be successful , the seeds must be scattered around in various directions .

If the seeds are spread out in many different areas , there is a better chance that some of the seeds will find the right conditions to grow .


Maple trees have fruits with wings that help the wind disperse the seeds .


Some flowering plants grow fleshy fruit that helps disperse their seeds .


When animals eat the fruit , the seeds pass through an animals digestive tract unharmed .


The seeds germinate after they are passed out with the animals feces .


Berries , citrus fruits , cherries , apples , and a variety of other types of fruits are all adapted to be attractive to animals , so the animals will eat them and disperse the seed -LRB- Figure 1.2 -RRB- .

Some non-fleshy fruits are specially adapted for animals to carry them on their fur .


You might have returned from a walk in the woods to find burrs stuck to your socks .


These burrs are actually specialized fruits designed to carry seeds to a new location .


But how do seeds travel to places they have never been before ?


To aid with seed dispersal , some plants have evolved special features that help their seeds travel over long distances .


One such strategy is to allow the wind to carry the seeds .


With special adaptations in the seeds , the seeds can be carried long distances by the wind .


For example , you might have noticed how the `` fluff `` of a dandelion moves in the wind .


Each piece of fluff carries a seed to a new location .


If you look under the scales of pine cone , you will see tiny seeds with `` wings `` that allow these seeds to be carried away by the wind .


Maple trees also have specialized fruits with wing-like parts that help seed dispersal -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- .


Without it , animals would not be able to live together in groups .


To live together with one another , these animals must be able to share information .

Ants , bees , and other social animals must cooperate .
Ants must cooperate .

All the lions in the pride cooperate , though there is still serious competition among the males .


Male lions work together to defend the other lions in the pride .


Female lions work together to hunt .


Another example of cooperation is seen with meerkats .


Meerkats are small mammals that live in Africa .


For example , young female meerkats act as babysitters .


They take care of the baby meerkats while their parents are away looking for food .


Members of the group may cooperate by sharing food .


Males cooperate by defending the pride .


Females cooperate by hunting and shar - ing the food .

Look at the ants pictured below -LRB- Figure 1.3 -RRB- .


They show very clearly why cooperation is important .


A single ant would not be able to carry this large bee back to the nest to feed the other ants .


Animals in many other species cooperate .


For example , lions live in groups called prides -LRB- Figure 1.4 -RRB- .


Even though two different species may not look similar , they may have similar internal structures that suggest they have a common ancestor .


That means both evolved from the same ancestor organism a long time ago .


Common ancestry can also be determined by looking at the structure of the organism as it first develops .


Some of the most interesting kinds of evidence for evolution are body parts that have lost their use through evolution -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- .


For example , most birds need their wings to fly .


Homologous structures are structures that have a common function and suggest common ancestry .

But the wings of an ostrich have lost their original use .


Structures that have lost their use through evolution are called vestigial structures .


They provide evidence for evolution because they suggest that an organism changed from using the structure to not using the structure , or using it for a different purpose .

Penguins do not use their wings , known as flippers , to fly in the air .


However , they do use them to move in the water .


The theory of evolution suggests that penguins evolved to use their wings for a different purpose .


A whales pelvic bones , which were once attached to legs , are also vestigial structures .


Whales are descended from land-dwelling ancestors that had legs .


Some of the oldest evidence of evolution comes from embryology , the study of how organisms develop .


The similarities between embryos suggests that these animals are related and have common ancestors .


For example , humans did not evolve from chimpanzees .


But the similarities between the embryos of both species suggest that we have an ancestor in common with chimpanzees .


As our common ancestor evolved , humans and chimpanzees went down different evolutionary paths and developed different traits .
As our common ancestor evolved , humans went down different evolutionary paths .
As our common ancestor evolved , humans developed different traits .

And , of course , succession occurs on brand new land .


This means that ecosystems change over time .


That forest may lie on land that was once covered by an ocean millions of years ago .


Lightning may have sparked a fire in a forest , destroying much of the plant life there .


Or the forest may have been cut down at one point for agricultural use , then abandoned and allowed to re-grow over time .

Since the land that results from these processes is completely new land , soil must first be produced .


Slowly , the shrubs are replaced by small trees .


Small trees then are succeeded by larger trees .

Since trees are more successful at competing for resources than grasses , a forest may be the end result of primary succession .

How is soil produced ?


Primary succession always starts with a pioneer species .


This is the species that first lives in the habitat .


If life is to begin on barren rock , which is typical of new land , the pioneer species would be an organism such as a lichen -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- .


A lichen is actually an organism formed from two species .


The lichen is able to thrive as both the fungus and the algae or bacteria contribute to the relationship .

Sometimes ecological succession occurs in areas where life has already existed .


This land was once used for growing crops .


Now that the field is abandoned , secondary succession has begun .


Pio - neer species , such as grasses , appear first , and then shrubs begin to grow .

Secondary succession is the type of succession that happens after something destroys the habitat , such as other natural disaster .

Abandoning a field that was once used for agriculture can also lead to secondary succession -LRB- Figure 1.2 -RRB- .


In this case , the pioneer species would be the grasses that first appear .


Slowly , the field would return to its natural state .


A forest fire can alter a habitat such that secondary succession occurs -LRB- Figure 1.3 and Figure 1.4 -RRB- .

Although the area will look devastated at first , the seeds of new plants are underground .


The climax community is a stable balance of all organisms in an ecosystem , and will remain stable unless a disaster strikes .

The climax community will remain stable unless a disaster strikes .

After the disaster , succession will start all over again .


Depending on the climate of the area , the climax community will look different .

For example the composition of our atmosphere stays fairly consistent , providing the ideal conditions for life .


When carbon dioxide levels increase in the atmosphere , plants grow more quickly .


As their growth continues , they remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere .


In this way , the amount of carbon dioxide stays fairly constant without human intervention .

Can you actually see evolution happening within your lifetime ?


Usually evolution takes a long time .


How long did it take for the giraffe to develop a long neck ?


How long did it take for the Galpagos finches to evolve ?


However , there are organisms that are evolving so fast that you can observe evolution !


A human takes about 22 years to go through one generation .


But some bacteria go through over a thousand generations in less than two months .


Some bacteria go through many generations in a few days .


We can actually trace their evolution as it is happening .


How long did it take for whales to evolve from land mammals ?


The rate of evolution depends on how many of an organisms genes have changed over a period of time .


The rate of evolution also depends on the generation time of a particular species .


Not all organisms evolve at the same rate .


Humans took millions of years to evolve from a mammal that is now extinct .


It is very difficult to observe evolution in humans .


If evolution can take a very long time , how can we visualize how it happens ?


Charles Darwin came up with the idea of an evolutionary tree to represent the relationships between different species and their common ancestors -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- .


Each point on the tree where one branch splits off from another represents the common ancestor of the species on the separate branches .


Scientists have drawn many different versions of the Tree of Life to show different features of evo - lution .


The Tree of Life on the right was made by Ernst Haeckel in 1879 .


The base of the tree represents the ancient ancestors of all life .


The separation into large branches shows where these original species evolved into new species .


The branches keep splitting into smaller and smaller branches as species continue to evolve into more and more species .
The branches keep splitting into smaller branches as species continue to evolve into more and more species .

Growth away from a stimulus is known as a tropism -LRB- Table 1.1 -RRB- .

Auxins , a class of plant hormones , allow plants to curve in specific directions as they grow .


The auxin moves to one side of the stem , where it starts a chain of events that cause rapid cell growth on just that one side of the stem .


With one side of the stem growing faster than the other , the plant begins to bend .


Name Phototropism Gravitropism Thigmotropism Stimulus Light Gravity Touch


This is an example of a tropism where light is the stimulus , known as phototropism -LRB- Figure 1.1 -RRB- .


To obtain more light for photosynthesis , leaves and stems grow toward the light .
To obtain more light for photosynthesis , leaves grow toward the light .

So , how do the roots of seeds underground know to grow downward ?


How do the roots deep in the soil know which way is up ?


Shoots , the new growth of a plant , also show a gravitropism , but in the opposite direction .


Plants also have a touch response called thigmotropism .


If you have ever seen a morning glory or the tendrils of a pea plant twist around a pole , then you know that plants must be able to sense the pole .

If you have ever seen the tendrils of a pea plant twist around a pole , then you know that plants must be able to sense the pole .

Thigmotropism works much like the other tropisms .


The plant grows straight until it comes in contact with the pole .


Then , the side of the stem that is in contact with the pole grows slower than the opposite side of the stem .


This causes the stem to bend around the pole .


If you have seen turtles before , what is the most noticeable thing about them ?


Pleurodira , which fold their necks to one side .

Do you ever wonder why things happen ?

To answer their questions , they make many observations .


Drawing general conclusions from many individual observations is called induction .


Now assume that someone gives you your first-ever helium balloon .


You discover that it rises up into the air if you dont hold on to it .


Based on this new observation , do you throw out your first idea about falling objects ?


No ; you decide to observe more helium balloons and try to find other objects that fall up instead of down .
No ; you decide to observe more helium balloons .
No ; you decide to try to find other objects that fall up instead of down .

Eventually , you come to a better understanding based on all your observations .


Your new conclusion is better because it applies to a wider range of observations .


You can learn more about induction , including its limits , by watching the video at this link : http : / / w MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below .


To understand how induction works , think about this simple example .


Assume you know nothing about gravity .


In fact , pretend youve never even heard of gravity .


Perhaps you notice that whenever you let go of an object it falls to the ground .


Your pencil rolls to the edge of the desk and down it goes .
Your pencil rolls to the edge of the desk .
Your pencil down it goes .

You throw a ball into the air , and it falls back down .
You throw a ball into the air .
it falls back down .

Based on many such observations -LRB- Figure 1.2 -RRB- , you conclude that all objects fall to the ground .


The above example shows how science generally advances .


New evidence is usually used to improve earlier ideas rather than entirely replace them .


It wasnt until strong telescopes were invented that people could make observations that let them choose the correct idea .


In this way , scientists gradually refine their ideas and increase our understanding of the world .

According to this theory , all matter consists of tiny particles that are in constant motion .

All fluids exert pressure like the air inside a tire .


The particles of fluids are constantly moving in all directions at random .


As the particles move , they keep bumping into each other and into anything else in their path .
As the particles move , they keep bumping into each other .
As the particles move , they keep bumping into anything else in their path .

These collisions cause pressure , and the pressure is exerted equally in all directions .
These collisions cause pressure .
the pressure is exerted equally in all directions .

When particles are crowded together in one part of their container , they quickly spread out to fill their container .


Thats why air entering a tire quickly spreads throughout the tire .


Pressure is the result of force acting on a given area .


It can be represented by the equation : Pressure = Force Area Pressure shows how concentrated the force is on a given area .


The smaller the area to which force is applied , the greater the pressure is .


Think about pressing a pushpin , like the one in Figure 15.2 , into a bulletin board .


However , the force that the pushpin applies to the bulletin board acts only over the tiny point of the pin .


This is a much smaller area , so the pressure the point applies to the bulletin board is much greater than the pressure you apply with you thumb .


As a result , the pin penetrates the bulletin board with ease .


In the equation for pressure , force is expressed in newtons -LRB- N -RRB- and area is expressed in square meters -LRB- m2 -RRB- .
In the equation for pressure , force is expressed in newtons -LRB- N -RRB- .
In the equation for pressure , area is expressed in square meters -LRB- m2 -RRB- .

Therefore , pressure is expressed in N/m2 , which is the SI unit for pressure .


This unit is also called the pascal -LRB- Pa -RRB- .


It is named for the scientist Blaise Pascal , whose discovery about pressure in fluids is described later in this lesson .


Pressure may also be expressed in the kilopascal -LRB- kPa -RRB- , which equals 1000 pascals .


When you know how much force is acting on a given area , you can calculate the pressure that is being applied to the area using the equation for pressure given above .


For example , assume that a big rock weighs 500 newtons and is resting on the ground on an area of 0.5 m2 .
For example , assume that a big rock weighs 500 newtons .
For example , assume that a big rock is resting on the ground on an area of 0.5 m2 .

Problem : If the break dancer lies down on the ground on her back , her weight is spread over an area of 0.75 m2 .


The pressure exerted on the ground by the rock is : Pressure = 500 N = 1000 N/m2 = 1000 Pa , or 1 kPa 0.5 m2 Sometimes pressure but not force is known .
The pressure exerted on the ground by the rock is : Pressure = 500 N = 1000 N/m2 = 1000 Pa , or 1 kPa 0.5 m2 Sometimes pressure is known .
The pressure exerted on the ground by the rock is : Pressure = 500 N = 1000 N/m2 = 1000 Pa , or 1 kPa 0.5 m2 Sometimes force is known .

To calculate force , the equation for pressure can be rewritten as : Force = Pressure Area For example , suppose another rock exerts 2 kPa of pressure over an area of 0.3 m2 .


How much does the rock weigh ?


Change 2 kPa to 2000 N/m2 and substitute it for pressure in the force equation : Force -LRB- Weight -RRB- = 2000 N/m2 0.3 m2 = 600 N Problem Solving Problem : A break dancer has a weight of 450 N . She is balancing on the ground on one hand .

The atmosphere also illustrate two factors that affect pressure in fluids : density .

A fluid exerts more pressure at greater depths .


This causes greater pressure .


Denser fluids such as water exert more pressure than less dense fluids such as air .


The particles of denser fluids are closer together , so there are more collisions in a given area .


This is illustrated in Figure 15.3 for water and air .
This is illustrated in Figure 15.3 for water .

Thats what the divers in Figure water as they swim closer to the surface .


Like water in the ocean , air in the atmosphere exerts pressure that increases with depth .


Most gas molecules in the atmosphere are pulled close to Earths surface by gravity .


As a result , air pressure decreases quickly at lower altitudes and then more slowly at higher altitudes .
As a result , air pressure decreases quickly at lower altitudes .
As a result , air pressure then more slowly at higher altitudes .

This is illustrated in Figure 15.6 .


The pressure of air in the atmosphere allows you to do many things , from sipping through a straw to simply breathing -LRB- see Figure 15.7 -RRB- .


When you first suck on a straw , you remove air from the straw , so the air pressure in the straw is lower than For more examples of how we use air pressure , watch the video at this URL : MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below .

Scientists investigate the world in many ways .


In different fields of science , researchers may use different methods and be guided by different theories and hypotheses .

In different fields of science , researchers may be guided by different hypotheses .

Which steps are repeated in Figure 2.1 ?


However , most scientists , including physical scientists , usually follow the general approach shown in Figure 2.1 .


This approach typically includes the following steps : Identify a research question or problem .

Communicate the results .


Scientists may follow these steps in a different sequence .


A scientific investigation begins with a question or problem .

A scientific investigation begins with a problem .

Often , the question arises because a scientist is curious about something she has observed .


An observation is any information that is gathered with the senses .


People often have questions about things they see , hear , or observe in other ways .
People often have questions about things they see in other ways .
People often have questions about things they hear in other ways .
People often have questions about things they observe in other ways .

For example , a teen named Tara has a bracelet with a magnetic clasp , like the one shown in Figure 2.2 .


Tara has noticed that the two magnets in the clasp feel harder to pull apart on cold days than on warm days .


She wonders whether temperature affects the strength of a magnet .


This important distinction , that evidence taken in by observation is experimented on by a scientist , is what separates legitimate science from other things which may pretend to be science .


Fields which claim to be scientific but dont use the scientific method are called `` pseudoscience . ``
Fields which claim to be scientific are called `` pseudoscience . ``

If a person cant gather data through some sort of instrument or sense information , they cant form a scientific conclusion .
If a person cant gather data through some sort of instrument , they cant form a scientific conclusion .
If a person cant sense information , they cant form a scientific conclusion .

If there is no way to prove the hypothesis false , there is no scientific claim either .


For example , if a friend told you that Snuffy visited him every day , but he was invisible whenever anyone walked into the room , this claim is not scientific , since there is no way to prove him false .
For example , if a friend told you that Snuffy visited him every day , this claim is not scientific , since there is no way to prove him false .
For example , if he was invisible whenever anyone walked into the room , this claim is not scientific , since there is no way to prove him false .

Developing a hypothesis may require creativity as well as reason .


Based on her hypothesis , Tara makes a prediction .


If she cools a magnet , then it will pick up more metal objects , such as paper clips .


She begins by forming a hypothesis .


Predictions are often phrased as `` if-then `` statements like this one .


A hypothesis is a potential answer to a question that can be tested by gathering information .


If it isnt possible to gather evidence to test an answer , then it can not be used as a scientific hypothesis .


But Snuffy would disappear whenever people came around .


So if someone said `` Is there a Snuffy on Sesame Street ? , `` that question would be unanswerable by science , since there isnt any test that can be performed because Snuffy would disappear as soon as a scientist showed up .


A variable is a factor that can take on different values .


Tara wonders what other variables might affect the strength of a magnet .


She thinks that the size and shape of a magnet might affect its strength .
She thinks that the size of a magnet might affect its strength .
She thinks that the shape of a magnet might affect its strength .

These are variables that must be controlled .


A control is a variable that is held constant so it wont influence the outcome of an experiment .


By using the same magnet at different temperatures , Tara is controlling for any magnet variables that might affect the results .


What other variables should Tara control ?


They are called the manipulated variable and the responding variable .
They are called the manipulated variable .
They are called the responding variable .

The manipulated variable -LRB- also called the `` independent variable `` -RRB- is a factor that is changed by the re - searcher .


For example , Tara will change the temperature of a magnet .


Temperature is the manipulated variable in her experiment .


The responding variable -LRB- also called the `` dependent variable `` -RRB- is a factor that the researcher predicts will change if the manipulated variable changes .


Tara predicts the number of paper clips attracted by the magnet will be greater at lower temperatures .


Number of paper clips is the responding variable in her experiment .


Not everything in physical science is as easy to study as magnets and paper clips .

Often , its important to investigate a problem in the real world instead of in a lab .


Scientists do field studies to gather real-world evidence .


Researchers should always communicate their results .


By sharing their results , they may be able to get helpful feedback from other scientists .


Another way to share results with other scientists is with presentations at scientific meetings -LRB- see Figure 2.4 -RRB- .


Creating websites and writing articles for newspapers and magazines are ways to share research with the public .
Creating websites are ways to share research with the public .
writing articles for newspapers are ways to share research with the public .
writing articles for magazines are ways to share research with the public .

Reporting on research also lets other scientists repeat the investigation to see whether they get the same results .


Getting the same results when an experiment is repeated is called replication .


If results can be replicated , it means they are more likely to be correct .


Replication of investigations is one way that a hypothesis may eventually become a theory .


Scientists can share their results in various ways .


Peer review means that the work is analyzed by peers , in this case other scientists .


This is the best way to ensure that the results are accurate and reported honestly .

Ethics refers to rules for deciding between right and wrong .


Researchers studying human subjects must tell their subjects about any potential risks of the research .


Subjects also must be told that they can refuse to participate in the research .


Researchers must inform coworkers , students , and members of the community about any risks of the research .
Researchers must inform coworkers about any risks of the research .
Researchers must inform students about any risks of the research .
Researchers must inform members of the community about any risks of the research .

Researchers studying living animals must treat them humanely .


They should provide for their needs and do what they can to avoid harming them -LRB- see Figure 2.5 -RRB- .
They should provide for their needs -LRB- see Figure 2.5 -RRB- .
They should do what they can to avoid harming them -LRB- see Figure 2.5 -RRB- .

Sometimes , science can help people make ethical decisions in their own lives , although science is unlikely to be the only factor involved .


For example , scientific evidence shows that human actions are affecting Earths climate .


Actions such as driving cars are causing Earth to get warmer .


Scientific research must be guided by ethical rules , including those listed below .


Does this mean that it is unethical to drive a car to work or school ?


What if driving is the only way to get there ?


As this example shows , ethical decisions are likely to be influenced by many factors , not just science .


Can you think of other factors that might affect ethical decisions such as this one ?


The rules help ensure that the research is done safely and the results are reliable .

One of the most important aspects of measuring is the system of units used for measurement .


Remember the Mars Climate Orbiter that opened this chapter ?


It shows clearly why a single system of measurement units is needed in science .


The measurement system used by most scientists is the International System of Units , or SI .
The measurement system used by most scientists is the International System of Units .

Some of these other units are introduced in later chapters .


Problem Solving Problem : Use information in Table 2.2 to convert 3 meters to inches .


Problem : Rod needs to buy 1 m of wire for a science experiment .


The wire is sold by the yard , not the meter .


SI is easy to use because everything is based on the number 10 .


Basic units are multiplied or divided by powers of ten to arrive at bigger or smaller units .
Basic units are multiplied by powers of ten to arrive at bigger units .
Basic units are multiplied by powers of ten to arrive at smaller units .
Basic units are divided by powers of ten to arrive at bigger units .

Prefixes are added to the names of the basic units to indicate the powers of ten .


The prefix kilo - means 1000 , so a kilometer is 1000 meters .


Can you infer what the other prefixes in the table mean ?


The SI scale for measuring temperature is the Kelvin scale .


However , some scientists use the Celsius scale instead .


The following conversion factors are used : Celsius !


Problem : The weather forecaster predicts a high temperature today of 86F .


Table 2.3 compares all three temperature scales .


This makes it easy to convert measurements between Kelvin and Celsius .


For example , to go from Celsius to Kelvin , just add 273 .


Measuring devices must be used correctly to get accurate measurements .


Figure 2.6 shows the correct way to use a graduated cylinder to measure the volume of a liquid .


Follow these steps when using a graduated cylinder to measure liquids : Place the cylinder on a level surface before adding liquid .


Read the mark on the glass that is at the lowest point of the curved surface of the liquid .

Use a bound laboratory notebook so pages will not be lost .


Write in ink for a permanent record .


Record the steps of all procedures .


Record all measurements and observations .

Date all entries , including drawings .


Doing science often requires calculations .


Converting units is just one example .


Calculations are also needed to find derived quantities .


The correct answer must be rounded down so there is just one digit to the right of the decimal point .


Using extra digits implies a greater degree of precision than actually exists .


The correct number of digits is called the number of significant figures .


This usually requires many zeroes to the left or right of the decimal point .

Pressure is defined as the amount of force pushing against a given area .


How much pressure a gas exerts depends on the amount of gas .


The gases in Earths atmosphere exert pressure against everything they contact .


The atmosphere rises high above Earths surface .


As a result , the pressure of the tower of air above a given spot on Earths surface is substantial .


This is illustrated in Figure 4.11 .


For a given amount of gas , scientists have discovered that the pressure , volume , and temperature of a gas are related in certain ways .


Because these relationships always hold in nature , they are called laws .


The laws are named for the scientists that discovered them .


Amontons law was discovered in the late 1600s by a French physicist named Guillaume Amonton .


According to Amontons law , if the volume of a gas is held constant , increasing the temperature of the gas increases its pressure .


Amontons law explains what happened .


As the tires rolled over the road , they got warmer .


The air inside the tires also warmed .


As it did , its pressure increased .


Its particles move more and have more collisions , so the pressure of the gas increases .
Its particles move more , so the pressure of the gas increases .
Its particles have more collisions , so the pressure of the gas increases .

A woman checked the air pressure in her tires before driving her car on a cold day -LRB- see Figure 4.16 -RRB- .


The tire pressure gauge registered 29 pounds of pressure per square inch .


After driving the car several miles on the highway , the woman stopped and checked the tire pressure again .
After driving the car several miles on the highway , the woman stopped .
After driving the car several miles on the highway , the woman checked the tire pressure again .

This time the gauge registered 32 pounds per square inch .


Because gas particles in the airlike particles of all fluidsare constantly moving and bumping into things , they exert pressure .

The pressure exerted by the air in the atmosphere is greater close to Earths surface and decreases as you go higher above the surface .
The pressure exerted by the air in the atmosphere is greater close to Earths surface .
The pressure exerted by the air in the atmosphere decreases as you go higher above the surface .

Q : Denver , Colorado , is called the mile-high city because it is located 1 mile -LRB- 1.6 km -RRB- above sea level .


There are two reasons why air pressure decreases as altitude increases : density and depth of the atmosphere .
There are two reasons why air pressure decreases as altitude increases : density of the atmosphere .
There are two reasons why air pressure decreases as altitude increases : depth of the atmosphere .

Most gas molecules in the atmosphere are pulled close to Earths surface by gravity , so gas particles are denser near the surface .


With more gas particles in a given volume , there are more collisions of particles and therefore greater pressure .
With more gas particles in a given volume , there are more collisions of particles .
With more gas particles in a given volume , there are greater pressure .

The depth -LRB- distance from top to bottom -RRB- of the atmosphere is greatest at sea level and decreases at higher altitudes .
The depth -LRB- distance from top to bottom -RRB- of the atmosphere is greatest at sea level .
The depth -LRB- distance from top to bottom -RRB- of the atmosphere decreases at higher altitudes .

With greater depth of the atmosphere , more air is pressing down from above .


Therefore , air pressure is greatest at sea level and falls with increasing altitude .
Therefore , air pressure is greatest at sea level .
Therefore , air pressure falls with increasing altitude .

The pressure of air in the atmosphere allows us to do many things , from sipping through a straw to simply breathing .


When you first suck on a straw , you remove air from the straw , so the air pressure in the straw is lower that the air pressure on the surface of the drink .


A fluid always flows from an area of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure , so the drink moves up the straw and into your mouth .

Any time one surface moves over another , it causes friction .


Friction is a force that opposes the motion of two surfaces that are touching , and friction between two surfaces always generates heat .

friction between two surfaces always generates heat .

Quickly rub your hands together and youll feel the heat generated by the friction between them .

As the tires moved over the road , friction between the tires and road generated heat .


In short , the tires got warmer and so did the air inside them .
In short , the tires got warmer .
In short , so did the air inside them .

The space inside a car tire is more-or-less fixed , so it has a constant volume .


The volume of air inside the tire was more-or-less constant , so the pressure of the air increased when it got warmer .


Lawrence found out the answer to that question when he measured the air pressure in his tire .


Increasing the temperature of a gas such as air , while holding its volume constant , increases the pressure of the gas .


This relationship between temperature and pressure of a gas is called Amontons law .


It was first proposed by a French scientist named Guillaume Amontons in the late 1600s .


Amontons gas law is just one of three commonly known gas laws .


Q : How does Amontons gas law explain the difference in air pressure in Lawrences tire ?


Why does the pressure of a gas increase as it gets warmer ?


Particles of a gas are constantly moving and bumping into things .
Particles of a gas are constantly moving .
Particles of a gas are constantly bumping into things .

The force of the collisions is measured by pressure .


Pressure is the amount of force exerted on a given area , such as pounds of force per square inch .


When gas particles heat up and gain energy , they move faster .
When gas particles heat up , they move faster .
When gas particles gain energy , they move faster .

This causes more collisions and greater pressure .
This causes more collisions .
This causes greater pressure .

Therefore , heating particles of gas in a closed space causes the pressure of the gas to increase .


Bernoullis law states that the pressure of a moving fluid such as air is less when the fluid is moving faster .


Pressure is the amount of force applied per given area .


The law is named for Daniel Bernoulli , a Swiss mathematician who discovered it during the 1700s .


Bernoulli used mathematics to arrive at his law .


Did you ever wonder how the wings of airplanes or birds allow them to fly ?
Did you ever wonder how the wings of airplanes allow them to fly ?
Did you ever wonder how the wings of birds allow them to fly ?

Bernoullis law provides the answer .


Look at the wings of the plane and hawk in the Figure 1.1 .
Look at the wings of the plane in the Figure 1.1 .
Look at the wings of the hawk in the Figure 1.1 .

The shape of the wings causes air to flow more slowly below them than above them .


This causes air pressure to be greater below the wings than above them .


The difference in air pressure lifts the plane or bird above the ground .

Its shape causes air to flow more slowlyand air pressure to be greaterabove the spoiler than below it .


As a result , air pressure pushes the car downward , helping it to stay on the track .


What does popping bubble wrap have to do with science ?


Actually , it demonstrates an important scientific law , called Boyles law .


Like other laws in science , this law describes what always happens under certain conditions .


Boyles law is one of three well-known gas laws , which state the relationships among temperature , volume , and pressure of gases .


According to Boyles law , if the temperature of a gas is held constant , then decreasing the volume of the gas increases its pressureand vice versa .


Thats what happens when you squeeze the bubbles of bubble wrap .


You decrease the bubbles volume , so the air pressure inside the bubbles increases until they pop .


Boyles law is named for Robert Boyle , the English scientist who discovered this relationship between gas volume and pressure .


Boyle based the law on his own controlled experiments .


Mainly because of his careful research and the details he provided about it , Boyle has been called the father of modern chemistry .

Imagine a container of gas molecules like the one in the Figure 1.1 .


The container in the sketch has a lid that can be pushed down to shrink the volume of the gas inside .


Notice what happens as the lid is lowered .


The gas molecules crowd closer together because there is less space for them to occupy and they have nowhere else to go .

When gas molecules bump into things , it creates pressure .


Pressure is greater when gas molecules occupy a smaller space , because the greater crowding results in more collisions .


In other words , decreasing the volume of a gas increases its pressure .


As the volume of gas in the container pictured in the Figure 1.1 gets smaller , the pressure of the gas molecules becomes greater .


Whenever you see a graph with this shape , it usually represents variables that have an inverse relationship , like gas volume and pressure .


Sketch a graph to show what the relationship between gas volume and pressure might look like .


Let the x-axis represent volume -LRB- V -RRB- and the y-axis represent pressure -LRB- P -RRB- .
Let the x-axis represent volume -LRB- V -RRB- .
Let the y-axis represent pressure -LRB- P -RRB- .

Lets see why this graph is correct .


Find the point on the line where volume is smallest .


Then find the point where volume is largest .

So Gay-Lussac controlled the effects of pressure by keeping it constant in their experiments .

Based on the results of the research , Charles developed a scientific law about gases .


According to Charless law , when the pressure of a gas is held constant , increasing its temperature increases its volume .


The opposite is also true : decreasing the temperature of a gas decreases it volume .


The last step of most scientific investigations is reporting the results .


When scientists communicate their findings , they add to the body of scientific knowledge , and thats how science advances .

When scientists communicate about their research , they may also get useful feedback from other scientists .


For example , comments from other scientists might help them improve their research design or interpret their findings in a different way .

For example , comments from other scientists might help them interpret their findings in a different way .

Other scientists can also repeat the research to see if they get the same results .


Q : Why might it be important for other scientists to repeat an investigation ?


A : If an investigation is repeated and different results are obtained , then it throws doubt on the original research .
A : If an investigation is repeated , then it throws doubt on the original research .
A : If different results are obtained , then it throws doubt on the original research .

On the other hand , if the same results are obtained , scientists can place more confidence in them .


The posters shown in the opening image are just one of several ways that scientists may communicate about their research .


Some of the most common ways scientists communicate are listed below .


Scientists may testify about their research before congress if their findings relate to matters of public policy , such as environmental pollution .


Scientists may communicate about their research to the general public .


Q : Why might it be important for scientists to communicate about their research to the general public ?


For example , assume that a scientist has investigated how driving habits are related to car crashes .


She might write a newspaper article to share the research results with the public so they can adopt driving habits that reduce the risk of crashes .


Considered by itself , the work of a single scientist may not seem that important , yet it may be an important piece of the overall structure .


But unless a scientist communicates re - search results , that single brick may never be added to the building .


Scientists may present papers about their research at scientific conferences .


This is a good way to quickly reach an audience of other scientists who are most interested in the research topic .


Scientists may publish articles about their research in peer-reviewed science journals .


Peer review means that the work is analyzed by peers , in other words , by other scientists .


The articles are published only if the other scientists are convinced that the research is accurate and honest .

Ethical dilemmas such as this often spur scientists to come up with new solutions to problems .


Thats what happened in the case of the Pacific yew .


Scientific investigations must be guided by what is right and what is wrong .

Researchers studying human subjects must tell their subjects that they have the right to refuse to participate in the research .


Human subjects also must be fully informed about their role in the research , including any potential risks .


Thats where ethical rules come in .


Here are some of the ethical rules that scientists must follow : Scientific research must be reported honestly .


They should do whatever they can to avoid errors in their data .


Sometimes , science can help people make ethical decisions in their own lives .


For example , scientific evidence shows that certain human actionssuch as driving cars that burn gasolineare contributing to changes in Earths climate .


This , in turn , is causing more severe weather and the extinction of many species .
This , in turn , is causing more severe weather .
This , in turn , is causing the extinction of many species .

A number of ethical decisions might be influenced by this scientific knowledge .

Often its important to investigate a problem in the real world instead of in a lab .


An investigation that gathers evidence in the real worldas the environmental chemist above is doingis called a field study .

A : To learn about the environment , scientists need to make observations in the real world .

This means gathering evidence in field studies ; collecting samples of water from a river is one example of this method .


The environmental scientist above will gather samples of river water in several different locations .


Then he will take the samples back to a lab to analyze them .


Describe how the samples of river water would compare in terms of the pollutants they contain .


A : All of the samples would contain about the same amount and types of pollutants .
A : All of the samples would contain about the same amount of pollutants .

This would be the sample taken at , the single source of pollution .
This would be the sample taken just downstream from , the single source of pollution .

Taking samples from different locations may help him identify the source of any pollution he finds .


Pollution can enter a river from a single source , such as a waste water pipe from a factory .


This is called point-source pollution .


Or pollution can enter a river in runoff rainwater that picks up pollutants as it runs over the ground .


This type of pollution enters the river everywhere .


This is called nonpoint-source pollution .


Q : Assume that the river is polluted only by nonpoint-source pollution .


The air inside each box expands to fill the available space , which is identical for both boxes .

In fact , a gas always spreads out to take up whatever space is available to it .


If a gas is enclosed in a container , it spreads out until it has the same volume as the container .


Q : The sketches in the Figure 1.1 represent two identical sealed boxes that contain only air particles -LRB- represented by dots -RRB- .


Which box contains a greater volume of air ?


Particles of gas are constantly moving in all directions at random .


A : Air pressure is greater in box B. Thats because there are more air particles in box B to bump into each other and into the sides of the container .
A : Air pressure is greater in box B. Thats because there are more air particles in box B to bump into each other .
A : Air pressure is greater in box B. Thats because there are more air particles in box B to bump into the sides of the container .

Therefore , the particles in box B exert more force on a given area .


This is modeled in the Figure 1.2 .


The force of the particles against things they bump into creates pressure .


Pressure is defined in physics as the amount of force pushing against a given area .


How much pressure a gas exerts depends on the number of gas particles in a given space and how fast they are moving .

People have probably wondered about the natural world for as long as there have been people .


So its no surprise that science has roots that go back thousands of years .


Some of the earliest contributions to science were made by Greek philosophers more than two thousand years ago .


It wasnt until many centuries later , however , that the scientific method and experimentation were introduced .

The dawn of modern science occurred even more recently .


It is generally traced back to the scientific revolution , which took place in Europe starting in the 1500s .


A Greek philosopher named Thales , who lived around 600 BCE , has been called the father of science for his ideas about the natural world .


This idea is called empiricism , and it is the basis of science today .

Just a few hundred years after Thales , the Greek philosopher Aristotle made a very important contribution to science .


Prior to Aristotle , other philosophers believed that they could find the truth about the natural world by inward reflectionin other words , just by thinking about it .


Aristotle , in contrast , thought that truth about the natural world could come only from observations of nature and inductive reasoning .

Starting in the mid-1500s , a scientific revolution occurred in Europe .


A : Copernicus ideas about the solar system are considered to be the starting point of modern astronomy .


They changed how all future scientists interpreted observations in astronomy .


Other contributions to science that occurred during the scientific revolution include : Keplers laws of planetary motion The model on the left shows what people believed about the solar system before Copernicus introduced the model on the right .


Many scientific advances were made during a period of just a couple of hundred years .


The revolution in science began when Copernicus made the first convincing arguments that the sunnot Earthis the center of what we now call the solar system .


This was a drastic shift in thinking about Earths place in the cosmos .


Around 1600 , the Italian scientist Galileo greatly improved the telescope , which had just been invented , and made many important discoveries in the field of astronomy .

Around 1600 , the Italian scientist Galileo made many important discoveries in the field of astronomy .

Some of Galileos observations provided additional evidence for Copernicus sun-centered solar system .


Q : Copernicus ideas about the solar system were so influential that the scientific revolution is sometimes called the Copernican revolution .


Why do you think Copernicus ideas led to a revolution in science ?


Another major shift in science occurred with the work of Albert Einstein -LRB- the rock star scientist pictured in the opening image -RRB- .


In 1916 , Einstein published his general theory of relativity .


This theory relates matter and energy .

Einsteins theory has been supported by all observations to date , whereas Newtons law of gravity does not apply to all cases .

Einsteins theory is still the accepted explanation for gravity today .


Q : How might Einsteins theory have influenced the course of science ?


A : Einsteins theory suggested new areas of investigation .


Many predictions based on the theory were later found to be true .


For example , black holes in the universe were predicted by Einsteins theory and later confirmed by scientific evidence .
For example , black holes in the universe were predicted by Einsteins theory .
For example , black holes in the universe were later confirmed by scientific evidence .

For example , it might be an educated guess about why a natural event occurs .


A scientific hypothesis must meet two criteria : A scientific hypothesis must be testable .


For a hypothesis to be testable means that it is possible to make observations that agree or disagree with it .
For a hypothesis to be testable means that it is possible to make observations that agree with it .
For a hypothesis to be testable means that it is possible to make observations that disagree with it .

If a hypothesis can not be tested by making observations , it is not scientific .


Consider this statement : `` There are invisible creatures all around us that we can never observe in any way . ``


Given the nature of the hypothesis , there are no observations a scientist could make to test whether or not it is false .
Given the nature of the hypothesis , there are no observations a scientist could make to test whether .

In addition , it must be possible to show that the hypothesis is false if it really is false .


The spacecraft may never find an inhabited planet , but that doesnt necessarily mean there isnt one .
The spacecraft may never find an inhabited planet .
that doesnt necessarily mean there isnt one .

Given the vastness of the universe , we would never be able to check every planet for life !


Consider this statement : There are other planets in the universe where life exists .


If it is true , it is at least theoretically possible to find evidence showing that its true .


For example , a spacecraft could be sent from Earth to explore the universe and report back if it discovers an inhabited planet .
For example , a spacecraft could be sent from Earth to explore the universe .
For example , a spacecraft could be sent from Earth to report back if it discovers an inhabited planet .

If such a planet were found , it would prove the statement is true .


Lets consider one last example , which is illustrated in the Figure 1.1 : `` Any two objects dropped at the same time from the same height will reach the ground at the same time -LRB- assuming the absence of air resistance -RRB- . ``


You could drop two objects at the same time from the same height and observe when they reach the ground .
You could drop two objects at the same time from the same height .
You could observe when they reach the ground .

Of course , you would have to drop the objects in the absence of air to prevent air resistance , but at least such a test is theoretically possible .

If the hypothesis above about falling objects really were false , it is likely that this would be discovered sooner after enough objects had been dropped .
If the hypothesis above about falling objects really were false , it is likely that this would be discovered later after enough objects had been dropped .

It takes just one exception to disprove a hypothesis .


Can this be demonstrated as well ?


No ; it would require testing all possible combinations of objects to show that they always reach the ground at the same time .


New objects are being made all the time that would have to be tested .


Its always possible an exception would be found in the future to disprove the hypothesis .


Science is more about gaining knowledge than it is about simply having knowledge .

The idea that Earths continents drift on the planets surface is a good example .


This idea was first proposed by a scientist named Alfred Wegener in the early 1900s .


Wegener also proposed that all of the present continents had once formed one supercontinent , which he named Pangaea .


Other scientists not only rejected Wegeners ideas , but ridiculed Wegener for even suggesting them .
Other scientists not only rejected Wegeners ideas .
Other scientists not only ridiculed Wegener for even suggesting them .

It wasnt until the 1950s that enough evidence had accumulated for scientists to realize that Wegener had been right .


Unfortunately , Wegener did not live long enough to see his ideas accepted .


For example , similar fossils and rock formations have been found on continents that are now separated by oceans .
For example , similar fossils have been found on continents that are now separated by oceans .
For example , similar rock formations have been found on continents that are now separated by oceans .

It is also now known that Earths crust consists of rigid plates that slide over molten rock below them .


This explains how continents can drift .


Even the shapes of todays continents show how they once fit together , like pieces of a giant jigsaw puzzle .


Giant steps in science may occur if a scientist introduces a major new idea .


For example , in 1666 , Isaac Newton introduced the idea that gravity is universal .


People had long known that things fall to the ground because they are attracted by Earth .


But Newton proposed that everything in the universe exerts a force of attraction on everything else .


This idea is known as Newtons law of universal gravitation .


Q : How do you think Newtons law of universal gravitation might have influenced the advancement of science ?

Besides raising questions for investigation , observations play another role in scientific investigations .


They help scientists gather evidence .


Copper at the surface of these pennies has combined with air to become a different substance with different properties .


The change in color shows that a chemical change has occurred .


Q : Some chemical changes release heat .


How could this change be observed ?


A : The sense of touchor a thermometercould be used to observe an increase in temperature .


For example , to investigate whether a chemical change has occurred , a scientist might observe whether certain telltale signs are present .


In some chemical changes , for example , a substance turns from one color to another .


In other chemical changes , an odor is produced or gas bubbles are released .

Pressure is the amount of force acting on a given area .


Thats because there is more and more water pressing down on you from above .


Scuba divers can dive without special vehicles because they dont go very deep below the surface of the water .


Nonetheless , because of the pressure of the water , scuba divers who go deeper than about 40 meters must return to the surface slowly .


The stops are needed to let the pressure inside their body adjust to the decreasing pressure of the water as they swim closer to the surface .


Q : Why would dissolved gases form bubbles as pressure decreases ?


A : Less gas can dissolve in a fluid at lower pressure .


Therefore , as pressure decreases , gases come out of solution and form bubbles .
Therefore , as pressure decreases , gases come out of solution .
Therefore , as pressure decreases , gases form bubbles .

It is represented by the equation : Pressure = Force Area The pressure exerted by a fluid increases if more force is applied or if the same force is applied over a smaller area .
It is represented by the equation : Pressure = Force Area The pressure exerted by a fluid increases if more force is applied .
It is represented by the equation : Pressure = Force Area The pressure exerted by a fluid increases if the same force is applied over a smaller area .

The equation for pressure can be rewritten as : Force = Pressure Area This equation shows that the same pressure applied to a greater area increases the force .


Some of the earliest scientific research on pressure in fluids was conducted by a French mathematician and physicist named Blaise Pascal -LRB- 1623-1662 -RRB- .

Some of the earliest scientific research on pressure in fluids was conducted by a French physicist named Blaise Pascal -LRB- 1623-1662 -RRB- .

The SI unit of pressure , the Pascal -LRB- Pa -RRB- , is named for him because of his important research .


One of Pascals major contributions is known as Pascals law .


This law states that a change in pressure at any point in an enclosed fluid is transmitted equally throughout the fluid .


Toothpaste is a fluid that is enclosed in a tube with a small opening at one end .


Look at the toothpaste tube in the Figure 1.1 .


When any part of the tube is squeezed , toothpaste squirts out the open end .


The pressure applied to the tube is transmitted equally throughout the toothpaste .


When the pressure reaches the open end , it forces toothpaste out through the opening .


The ability of fluids to transmit pressure in this way can be very usefulbesides getting toothpaste out of a tube !


For example , hydraulic brakes in a car use fluid to transmit pressure , and when they do , they also increase force .

You can see how hydraulic brakes work in the Figure 1.2 .


A : The arrows representing the force applied by the break cylinder are larger than the arrow representing the force applied by the brake pedal mechanism .


A larger arrow indicates greater force .


Q : How do hydraulic brakes increase the force that is applied to the brake shoes ?


A : The pressure exerted by the fluid on the brake shoes is applied over a larger area .


When pressure acts over a larger area , it increases the force -LRB- Force = Pressure Area -RRB- .


Hydraulic car lifts also use fluid to transmit pressure and increase force .

The lifts are used to raise cars , which are very heavy , so mechanics can work on them from underneath .


Most careers in physical science require a 4-year college degree in one of these fields .


Some careers require more advanced education as well .


Q : Besides becoming an astronaut , a degree in physical science can prepare you for many other careers .

Training in the physical science field of physics is needed for the careers described in the Figure 1.1 .

When particles are crowded together in one part of an enclosed space , such as the air particles first entering a tire , they quickly spread out to fill all the available space .


Thats because particles of fluids always move from an area of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure .


This explains why air entering a tire through a tiny opening quickly fills the entire tire .


Pressure is defined as the amount of force acting on a given area .


Therefore , pressure can be represented by this equation : Pressure = Force Area Pressure shows how concentrated the force is on a given area .


Think about pressing a pushpin , like the one in the Figure 1.1 , into a bulletin board .


You apply force with your thumb to the broad head of the pushpin .


This is a much smaller area , so the pressure the point applies to the bulletin board is much greater than the pressure you apply with your thumb .


In the above equation for pressure , force is expressed in Newtons -LRB- N -RRB- and area is expressed in square meters -LRB- m2 -RRB- .
In the above equation for pressure , force is expressed in Newtons -LRB- N -RRB- .
In the above equation for pressure , area is expressed in square meters -LRB- m2 -RRB- .

This unit is also called the Pascal -LRB- Pa -RRB- .


It is named for the scientist Blaise Pascal whose discoveries about pressure in fluids led to a law of the same name .


Pressure may also be expressed in the kilopascal -LRB- kPa -RRB- , which equals 1000 Pascals .


For example , assume that a rock weighs 5000 N and is resting on the ground on an area of 0.5 m2 .
For example , assume that a rock weighs 5000 N .
For example , assume that a rock is resting on the ground on an area of 0.5 m2 .

The pressure exerted on the ground by the rock is : N = 10000 N/m2 = 10000 Pa , or 10 kPa Pressure = 5000 0.5 m2 Sometimes pressure but not force is known .
The pressure exerted on the ground by the rock is : N = 10000 N/m2 = 10000 Pa Pressure = 5000 0.5 m2 Sometimes pressure is known .
The pressure exerted on the ground by the rock is : N = 10000 N/m2 = 10000 Pa Pressure = 5000 0.5 m2 Sometimes force is known .
The pressure exerted on the ground by the rock is : N = 10000 N/m2 = 10 kPa Pressure = 5000 0.5 m2 Sometimes pressure is known .
The pressure exerted on the ground by the rock is : N = 10000 N/m2 = 10 kPa Pressure = 5000 0.5 m2 Sometimes force is known .

To calculate force , the equation for pressure can be rewritten as : Force = Pressure Area For example , suppose another rock exerts 10 kPa of pressure over an area of 0.4 m2 .


Then substitute this value for pressure in the force equation as follows : Force -LRB- Weight -RRB- = 10,000 N/m2 0.4 m2 = 4,000 N Q : The break-dancer in the Figure 1.2 has a weight of 800 N . He is balancing on the palm of one hand .


A : Use the equation for pressure : 800 N Pressure = 0.02 m2 = 40000 Pa , or 40 kPa Q : If the break-dancer lies down on the ground on his back , his weight is spread over an area of 0.75 m2 .
A : Use the equation for pressure : 800 N Pressure = 0.02 m2 = 40000 Pa Q : If the break-dancer lies down on the ground on his back , his weight is spread over an area of 0.75 m2 .
A : Use the equation for pressure : 800 N Pressure = 0.02 m2 = 40 kPa Q : If the break-dancer lies down on the ground on his back , his weight is spread over an area of 0.75 m2 .

Two factors influence the pressure of fluids .


Deeper in a fluid , all of the fluid above it results in more weight pressing down .


This causes greater pressure the deeper you go .

Scientists also have to check their work .


The results of an investigation are not likely to be well accepted unless the investigation is repeatedusually many timesand the same result is always obtained .


Getting the same result when an experiment is repeated is called replication .


If research results can be replicated , it means they are more likely to be correct .


Repeated replication of investigations may turn a hypothesis into a theory .


On the other hand , if results can not be replicated they are likely to be incorrect .


In 1998 , a British researcher published an article in a medical journal reporting that he had found a link between a common childhood vaccine and autism -LRB- see Figure 1.1 -RRB- .


They learned that its author had received a large amount of money to find evidence that the vaccine causes autism , so he faked his research results .


If other scientists had not tried to replicate the research , the truth might never have come out .


According to the article , children in his study developed autism soon after receiving the vaccine .


Following publication of the article , many parents refused to have their children vaccinated .


Several epidemics occurred as a result , and some children died of the diseases .
Several epidemics occurred as a result .
some children died of the diseases .

Soon after the original study was published , other researchers tried to replicate the research .


No other studies could find a link between the vaccine and autism .


As a result , scientists became convinced that the original results were incorrect .


Eventually , investigators determined that the original study was a fraud .


Learn the symbols so you will recognize the dangers .


Many common safety symbols are shown below .

There must be at least two variables in any experiment : a manipulated variable and a responding variable .
There must be at least two variables in any experiment : a manipulated variable .
There must be at least two variables in any experiment : a responding variable .

A manipulated variable is a variable that is changed by the researcher .


You could clock the time it takes the object to travel from the top to the bottom of the ramp .


The less time it takes , the faster the average speed down the ramp .


Q : What variables might affect the speed of an object down a ramp ?


A : Variables might include factors relating to the ramp or to the object .
A : Variables might include factors relating to the ramp .
A : Variables might include factors relating to the object .

An example of a variable relating to the ramp is its steepness .


An example of a variable relating to the object is the way it movesit might roll or slide down the ramp .
An example of a variable relating to the object is the way it movesit might roll down the ramp .
An example of a variable relating to the object is the way it movesit might slide down the ramp .

Either of these variables could be manipulated by the researcher , so you could choose one of them for your manipulated variable .


A manipulated variable is also called an independent variable .


A responding variable is a variable that the researcher predicts will change if the manipulated variable changes .


A responding variable is also called a dependent variable .

URL : Q : If you were to do an experiment to find out what influences the speed of an object down a ramp , what would be the responding variable ?


You could measure it indirectly with a stopwatch .


Assume you are sliding wooden blocks down a ramp in your experiment .


You choose steepness of the ramp for your manipulated variable .


The ramps varied not only in steepness but also in smoothness .


The block on the smoother ramp went faster than the block on the rougher ramp , even though the rougher ramp was steeper .


This example illustrates another important aspect of experiments : experimental controls .


A control is a variable that must be held constant so it wont influence the outcome of an experiment .


The control can be used as a standard for comparison between experiments .


In the case of your ramp experiment , smoothness of the ramps should have been controlled by making each ramp out of the same material .


For other examples of controls in an experiment , watch the video below .


It is Part II of the above video on bouncing balls .


You want to measure how changes in steepness affect the time it takes a block to reach the bottom of the ramp .


URL : Q : What other variables do you think might influence the outcome of your ramp experiment ?


How could these other variables be controlled ?


A : Other variables might include variables relating to the block .


For example , a smoother block would be expected to go down a ramp faster than a rougher block .


You decide to test two blocks on two ramps , one steeper than the other , and see which block reaches the bottom first .
You decide to test two blocks on two ramps , one steeper than the other .
You decide to see which block reaches the bottom first .

You raise the rough board higher so it has a steeper slope -LRB- see sketch below -RRB- .


You let go of both blocks at the same time and observe that the block on the ramp with the gentler slope reaches the bottom sooner .
You let go of both blocks at the same time .

Many crimes are solved using inductive reasoning .


Q : How might the police detective pictured above use inductive reasoning to solve the crime ?

For example , he might find fingerprints left behind by the perpetrator .
For example , he might find other evidence left behind by the perpetrator .

The detective might eventually find enough clues to be able to conclude the identity of the most likely suspect .


A simple example will help you understand how inductive reasoning works in science .


Suppose you grew up on a planet named Quim , where there is no gravity .


You see round objects rising up into the sky , rather than falling toward the ground as you expect .


Clearly , your first conclusionalthough based on many pieces of evidenceis incorrect .


You need to gather more evidence to come to a conclusion that explains all of your observations .


Evidence that not everything falls to the ground on Earth .


Q : What conclusion might you draw based on the additional evidence of the balloons rising instead of falling ?


In fact , assume youve never even heard of gravity .


Then , when you let go of your communications device , it falls to the ground as well .


On Quim , nothing ever falls to the ground .


For example , if you had let go of your communications device back home , it would have just stayed in place by your upper appendage .


You notice that everything you let go of falls to the ground .


Using inductive reasoning , you conclude that all objects fall to the ground on Earth .


Inductive reasoning cant solve a crime or arrive at the correct scientific conclusion with 100 percent certainty .
Inductive reasoning cant solve a crime .
Inductive reasoning cant arrive at the correct scientific conclusion with 100 percent certainty .

Its always possible that some piece of evidence remains to be found that would disprove the conclusion .


Thats why jurors in a trial are told to decide whether the defendant is guilty without a reasonable doubtnot without a shred of doubt .


However , it can be supported by so much evidence that it is accepted without a reasonable doubt .


It may seem like common sense that bumper cars change their motion when they collide .


Thats because all objects behave this way - its the law !

A scientific law is a statement describing what always happens under certain conditions .


Other examples of laws in physical science include : Newtons first law of motion Newtons second law of motion Newtons law of universal gravitation Law of conservation of mass Law of conservation of energy Law of conservation of momentum


Scientific laws state what always happen .


A : Something else that always happens in nature is water flowing downhill rather than uphill .


This could be expressed as the law , When water flows over a hill , it always flows from a higher to a lower elevation .


It can let you let you predict what will happen under certain circumstances .


For example , Newtons third law tells you that the harder you hit a softball with a bat , the faster and farther the ball will travel away from the bat .

They dont explain why things happen .

This could be expressed as a scientific law .

However , most scientists follow the general steps outlined in the Figure 1.1 .


This approach is sometimes called the scientific method .


For example , scientists may follow the steps in a different order .


A simple example will help you understand how the scientific method works .


While Cody eats a bowl of cereal -LRB- Figure 1.2 -RRB- , he reads the ingredients list on the cereal box .


A : Codys question would be , Is there enough iron in a flake of cereal for it to be attracted by a strong magnet ?


His hypothesis would be , The iron content of a flake of cereal is too low for it to be attracted by a strong magnet .


Q : Based on this evidence , what should Cody conclude ?


A : Cody should conclude that his hypothesis is incorrect .


There is enough iron in a flake of cereal for it to be attracted by a strong magnet .


Q : If Cody were a scientist doing an actual scientific investigation , what should he do next ?


A : He should report his results to other scientists .


He notices that the cereal contains iron .


Cody is The general steps followed in the scientific method .

The term theory is used differently in science than it is used in everyday language .

they have withstood the test of time .
A number of theories in science were first proposed many decades ago .
A number of theories in science were first proposed centuries ago .

An example of a physical science theory that has mainly withstood the test of time is Daltons atomic theory .


Dalton determined that a given compound always consists of the same elements in exactly the same proportions , no matter how small the sample of the compound .


This idea is illustrated for the compound water in the Figure 1.1 .


Dalton concluded from this evidence that elements must be made up of tiny particles in order to always combine in the same specific proportions in any given compound .


Water is a compound that consists of the elements hydrogen -LRB- H -RRB- and oxygen -LRB- O -RRB- .
Water is a compound that consists of the elements hydrogen -LRB- H -RRB- .
Water is a compound that consists of the elements oxygen -LRB- O -RRB- .

Like other compounds , the smallest particles of water are called molecules .


Each molecule of water -LRB- H2 O -RRB- contains two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen .
Each molecule of water -LRB- H2 O -RRB- contains two atoms of hydrogen .
Each molecule of water -LRB- H2 O -RRB- contains one atom of oxygen .

Q : Dalton thought that atoms are the smallest particles of matter .


Scientists now know that atoms are composed of even smaller particles .


Does this mean that the rest of Daltons atomic theory should be thrown out ?


A : The discovery of particles smaller than atoms doesnt mean that we should scrap the entire theory .

Instead of throwing out Daltons theory , scientists have expanded on it .

According to Daltons atomic theory , all substances consist of tiny particles called atoms .


Furthermore , all the atoms of a given element are identical , whereas the atoms of different elements are always different .


These parts of Daltons atomic theory are still accepted today , although some other details of his theory have since been disproven .


Dalton based his theory on many pieces of evidence .


For example , he studied many substances called compounds .


These are substances that consist of two or more different elements .


The formation of scientific theories is generally guided by the law of parsimony .


The word parsimony means thriftiness .


Conversely , the theory that makes the fewest assumptions , assuming it is well supported by evidence , is most likely to be correct .


The law of parsimony states that , when choosing between competing theories , you should select the theory that makes the fewest assumptions .


But several centuries ago , it was believed that Earth is at the center of the solar system and the other planets orbit around Earth .
But several centuries ago , it was believed that Earth is at the center of the solar system .
But several centuries ago , it was believed that the other planets orbit around Earth .

While it is possible to explain the movement of planets according to this theory , the explanation is unnecessarily complex .


A : The more assumptions that must be made to form a scientific theory , the more chances there are for the theory to be incorrect .

Consider the problem of developing a solar-powered car .


Many questions would have to be researched in the design process .


For example , what is the best shape for gathering the suns rays ?


How will sunlight be converted to useable energy to run the car ?

After researching the answers , possible designs are developed .
